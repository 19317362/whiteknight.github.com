I've thrown together a little website for the [Rosella][] project using the
cool Github Pages feature. The website is located at
[http://whiteknight.github.com/Rosella/](http://whiteknight.github.com/Rosella/).

Right now it only contains a brief overview of the library, but eventually I
want to expand it with documentation and tutorials about how to use all this
fun new code in your projects.
