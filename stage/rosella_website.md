I've thrown together a little website for the [Rosella][] project using the
cool Github Pages feature. The website is located at
[http://whiteknight.github.com/Rosella/](http://whiteknight.github.com/Rosella/).

The website doesn't look so great. I know it, because I'm no artist and I
don't typically make good looking things. My son is the one possible exception
to this rule. It gives me another opportunity to play around with CSS and
pretend to be competent in that technology, and that kind of pretend playing
makes me happy.

I am preparing to cut a release of Rosella following the 3.3 release of Parrot
in April. This website is being built in anticipation of that release: I want
to have some online documentation, including some short code examples, in
place to help with new users of the project. Specifically, I think some
GSoC students might be able to make use of some of these tools, and I want
to give them plenty of documentation to pour over if they do.

The first Rosella release will contain nine different libraries: Core,
Action, Container, Proxy, Test, Harness, MockObject, Event, and Winxed (the
library, not the language compiler). All eight of these are described and
documented on the website, including high-level overviews, explanations of the
various functionality, and a growing handfull of code examples.

Future releases of Rosella will likely include fun new libraries. I have about
a half dozen more libraries in various stages of development, and at least
that many ideas for new libraries running around in my head. I'll be making
posts about these new libraries after the release, as they start to mature.

Explanations and code examples are extremely important in the case of some of
the more abstract libraries, such as Proxy or Action. For some of the more
practical libraries (Test and Harness for instance), the usefulness is usually
more immediately apparent. In these cases it's good to see working examples
for how these libraries can be used, so that the user can get up to speed with
them quickly.
