I'm happy to <i>finally</i> announce the <a href="http://github.com/Whiteknight/parrot-linear-algebra/tree/Release_1">first official release</a> of <a href="http://whiteknight.github.com/parrot-linear-algebra/">Parrot-Linear-Algebra</a> (PLA). PLA is an extension project for the <a href="http://parrot.org/">Parrot Virtual Machine</a> which brings linear algebra support and bindings to the BLAS library.<br /><br />PLA has several dependencies (see below). Once you have those installed properly, you can obtain and install PLA using <a href="http://gitorious.com/parrot-plumage/parrot-plumage">Plumage</a>, the Parrot package manager:<br /><br /><pre>plumage install parrot-linear-algebra<br /></pre><br />Or, if you prefer to do things the hard way, you can use this series of commands to obtain and build PLA like this:<br /><br /><pre>git clone git://github.com/Whiteknight/parrot-linear-algebra.git pla<br />cd pla<br />parrot-nqp setup.nqp build<br />parrot-nqp setup.nqp test<br />parrot-nqp setup.nqp install </pre><pre> </pre><span style="font-size: x-large;">Dependencies</span><br /><br />Before you get started with PLA, you must install some dependencies.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Parrot</span><br /><br />You must have an installed copy of the Parrot Virtual Machine, <a href="http://parrot.org/news/2010/Parrot-2.8.0">version 2.8.0</a> or later.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">BLAS</span><br /><br />PLA links to the BLAS library. You can use either the <a href="http://netlib.org/blas/">standard reference BLAS library from netlib.org</a>, or you can use one of the <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> or CBLAS variants. There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms#Implementations">other implementations of BLAS</a>, though PLA may not currently be compatible with all of them (patches and error reports welcomed!)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Kakapo</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.gitorious.com/kakapo/kakapo">Kakapo</a> is a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kakapo-parrot/">development framework for the NQP language</a>. It provides a unit testing library which PLA uses to implement its test suite. A special version of Kakapo is required for PLA release 1. You can use this sequence of commands to get and install that version:<br /><br /><pre>git clone git://github.com/Whiteknight/kakapo.git kakapo<br />cd kakapo<br />checkout tag PLA-version-1<br />parrot-nqp setup.nqp build<br />parrot-nqp setup.nqp install<br /></pre><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Linux</span><br /><br />Sorry Windows guys! At the moment PLA only runs on Linux and other Unixy systems. Windows support is planned for future releases, but didn't make it into this one.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Next Release</span><br /><br />PLA releases are not on a regular schedule. A new release might not come out again until new features are added or until something in the toolchain becomes incompatible.<br /><br />Here are a list of TO-DO features that will eventually make it into future releases:<br /><ol><li>Bindings to the LAPACK library, to add more linear algebra utilities</li><li>Windows support, including a Windows installer</li><li>Writing bindings for other programming languages which run on Parrot, including <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl 6</a>.</li><li>Adding additional types, including special vector types and multi-dimensional tensor types.</li></ol>If any of these things interest you, or if you have other cool ideas, please feel free to let me know and get involved!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">New Participants Welcome!</span><br /><br />Interested in PLA or linear algebra in general? You can fork a copy of PLA and start contributing <i>right now</i>! I'm happy to talk to interested contributors, and to add patches for bugfixes and new features into the core repository. Please let me know if you're interested in helping out.<br /><br />If you have specific feature requests that you would like to see added to PLA, but aren't able to implement them yourself, please let me know. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Thanks</span><br /><br />I want to offer a big thanks to the greater Parrot community for helping in various ways. PLA relies on several tools and libraries, the result of many man-hours of work by Parrot community contributors.
