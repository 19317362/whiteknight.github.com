Yesterday was the <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/parrotsketch/2009-12-13">big online Parrot Developer Meeting</a>, which <a href="/2009/12/10/parrot_developer_meeting.html.html">I mentioned briefly</a> last week. The idea was to have a meeting similar to the large Parrot Developer Summit from 2008 to reevaluate our long-term development roadmap and make sure we were on the right path for 2.0 and beyond. I had been one of the more vocal people saying that our roadmap up to that point was incomplete, outdated, and not reflective of our recent development priorities, so I'm particularly happy that this meeting was held.<br /><br />It was a very productive meeting too, although due to time constraints and internet connectivity issues I wasn't able to participate as actively as I wanted. The meeting started with a 30-minute project retrospective lead by chromatic, a statement of our short-term project goals, some discussion of changes to the support policy, and then an item-by-item review of some of our existing and new roadmap items.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">Short-Term Goals</span><br /><br /><a href="http://use.perl.org/%7Epmichaud/journal/39411">Rakudo*</a> ("Rakudo Star") is due shortly after Parrot's 2.3 release, and is going to be a major milestone for both projects. James Keenan suggested, to much agreement, that Parrot should be focusing almost single-mindedly on the needs of Rakudo* between now and then to help make that release as successful as possible. The desired return on investiment is that the success of Rakudo* will help to spur on increased interest from new and existing HLL developers, and demonstrate the Parrot is a viable platform to host these compiler projects.<br /><br />Among the major needs of Rakudo* are improved Parrot performance. Specifically, optimizations for PCC and an overhaul of the GC were both mentioned as paths towards this goal.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">Support Policy</span><br /><br />Several days ago<a href="http://lists.parrot.org/pipermail/parrot-dev/2009-December/003456.html"> I sent an email to the list</a> proposing that we rewrite our support policy to alleviate some of the problems people have been having with our long deprecation cycles. While these long deprecation cycles are good for stability and developer piece-of-mind, it has been a strong negative influence on development speed. Top this off with the fact that many of our systems are still immature and in need of major overhaul, and we run into some serious problems.<br /><br />My suggestion, while a catalyst for discussion, was not accepted. What we have decided to do in it's stead is to shorten our deprecation cycle by adding more supported releases. Parrot will now have a supported release every 3 months instead of every 6. So next year we will support releases 2.0, 2.3, 2.6 and 2.9. Hopefully this improved turnaround time will alleviate some of our issues and increase the speed of development.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">Roadmap</span><br /><br />We did a complete item-by-item review of our roadmap items, and assigned specific releases when we would like to have each feature in place. Here is a quick listing of some of the major items on this list:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="/2009/12/01/gc_gets_kick_start.html.html">Improved GC</a> (2.3)</li><li>Fixed L-Value semantics (2.6)</li><li>Overhaul NCI (2.6)</li><li><a href="/2009/05/01/asynchronous_io_in_parrot.html.html">Asynchronous IO</a> (2.9)</li><li>Concurrency (3.0)</li><li>Strings overhaul, including immutable strings (3.0)</li><li><a href="/2009/11/10/planning_for_lorito.html.html">Lorito</a> (3.0)</li><li>PIRC (3.0)</li><li><a href="/2009/09/13/first_steps_on_jit_overhaul.html.html">JIT</a> (3.3)</li></ul>I personally suspect that some of these numbers will be rearranged in practice (AIO and Concurrency are going to go closely together, I predict Strings will become a pain-point sooner than 3.0, PIRC is going to be affected by Lorito in unforseen ways, etc), but overall it's a decent and well thought-out list, and I won't nitpick it. We would be lucky if we could get even half of these things done before 3.3, but I hold out hope that we could do better than that. I am especially hopeful considering the way our development team is steadily growing.<br /><br />So that's my quick recap of the developers meeting. I'm planning to read back over the transcripts, and I'll write more posts about any topics that I find to be of particular interest.
