Ubuntu 11.10 is out today and I've been taking it for something of a test drive.
What I can say, after a scant few hours of use, is that it is far superior to
11.04.

When 11.04 came out and Unity was the default UI, people from across the
interbuttz were talking about how much of a travesty it was, how inferior of a
desktop experience it was, and so on and so forth. There was a quality to the
software that felt like it wasn't quite ready for general use, but I didn't have
too many problems with it in general. In terms of my desktop experience I'm a
minimalist kind of guy so I didn't mind that the first release of Unity wasn't
infinitely customizable and whatever. I stuck with Unity for a few reasons: It
was mostly stable for me, having it was far less of a pain in the ass than
trying to get Gnome3 or Gnome Shell working without irreversable side effects,
and I genuinely liked the look of it and the direction I knew it was heading in.

On top of that, I'm a pretty patient guy. I'm willing to stick with a peice of
software I enjoy despite some flaws, if I think that my concerns are being
addressed. I've been sticking with FireFox despite some of the memory-management
concerns because I know that the Mozilla devs are aware of the issues and are
working on them (Whether they are doing it as quickly as we all want is another
issue, which is not worth addressing here). I know that the Ubuntu people are
working on Unity and I'm happy enough to stick with it and see where the train
leads.

Switching to a new peice of software can be a huge pain anyway. Learning the
new software and becoming familiar, not just competent, enough for quick and
thoughtless nagivation is important. I don't mind testing out other alternatives
but making constant switches back and forth between the best and the
temporarily-slightly-better-next-best is a huge waste of my time. When there's
a compelling reason to switch I will, but I don't have the time or the energy
to be flipping back and forth between bits of software where quality differences
between them are small. It doesn't help that Gnome3 has been going through some
growing pains of its own since Ubuntu 11.04 came out, so it's not like either
alternative represented an indisputably superior and more mature option.

And don't talk to me about using KDE or Xfce or anything else. I've tried other
things in the past and, despite the shortcomings, the Gnome-based options are
much more in line with what I need in a computer. Some people say it's
computing for idiots, or a forced simplicity that trades functionality for
superficial style. I've heard all the arguments before, and I really don't care.
Like I said, I'm a minimalist kind of guy. The single thing I need most is easy
access to a terminal. After that, in decreasing order of importance, I need the
ability to get to a web browser, the ability to get to an IRC client, 
a non-terminal text editor which wasn't originally developed before I was born,
and very little else. Anything between these few programs, all those fancy
colors and menus and UI details and whatever, those are just useless window
dressing to me.

Gnome, especially Unity, is exactly what I need. It gives me access to the
programs I want to use. It doesn't get in my way or require too much input or
management. On top of that, it looks pretty damn good.

Enter 11.10 and the story is much different from what it was 6 months ago. Unity 
is solid now. This is what should have been the first public release of Unity, 
this is what people wished had been shipped with 11.04. Better late than never, 
I say. In this case it's much better.

The new Ubuntu Mono font is very nice. In my un-professional opinion, it's in
the same league as other modern monospaced fonts like Microsoft's Consolas,
which I have been particularing enjoying when I need to use it.

GCC 4.6 is nice, but I haven't used it much. Improved 32-bit compatibility for
64-bit machines is nice too. I've always found it to be unnecessarily painful
to install 32-bit packages on my 64-bit laptop. It happens infrequently enough
that I haven't raised a stink about it, but if it's easier now that's icing.
