As part of my ever-expanding Rosella library, I've added some REPL
functionality. The core REPL logic is being developed in the existing Winxed
Rosella library, with a small separate frontend being developed independently.
As with all Rosella functionally, the REPL is being developed with
customizability in mind. Almost all parts of it can be subclassed or replaced
to provide custom functionality, and more is coming too.

REPL, short for "Read, Eval and Print Loop", is a cool kind of technology that
many programming language interpreters make use of.
