Create an LALR parser generator tool. The tool should be written in one of the lower-level languages which run on Parrot (PIR, NQP, Winxed, other) for maximum portability. The parser generator should take a language specification and compile it into an LALR parser in a manner similar to YACC/Bison. The generator parser likewise can be in any suitable language. For this project, a working LALR parser generator engine is more important than the ability to understand a huge number of input patterns and pattern modifiers.

Create a new code generation backend for ANTLR to produce parsers which run on Parrot. Target languages can be any language which runs on Parrot, although lower-level languages are preferred for performance and portability (PIR, NQP, Winxed, etc). The backend should be able to create working code for the full range of ANTLR features.
