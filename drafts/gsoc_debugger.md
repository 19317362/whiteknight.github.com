Parrot needs a new debugger. There exists a toolset called "parrot-instrument" which can be used to insert introspection, analysis, and manipulation functions into Parrot internals. You may optionally (preferrably) use Parrot-Instrument as the basis for your new debugger or create a new one from scratch. A successful debugger will have the ability to set break-points on subroutines at the PIR and HLL level, set watchpoints on registers or individual PMCs, and introspect state information from a running program. The debugger should read information from annotations so that it can be used to work with various HLLs. Performance of code executing under the debugger is not a primary concern for the initial deliverable.
