Haven't blogged in a little while, feel like it's high-time for an update. I can do this piece-wise:<br /><ol><li>I got accepted in to the Google Summer of Code program! I'm going to be working on a new garbage collector for <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org">Parrot</a>. I've never done a garbage collector before, or any kind of advanced memory management system for that matter, so this is bound to be a learning experience. I'll probably be writing about this pretty regularly, and things have only gotten started here, so I won't write too much about it now.<br /></li><li>I had a phone interview with GE yesterday. I'm excited because it was my first interview in a long while, and I feel like it went well. Of course, you never know if you did poorly until several months go by with no more calls or emails.<br /></li><li>I've been doing some work on a new book designing tool for Wikibooks. It's not ready for public release yet (although I have gotten one or two people to beta test it for me). I'm sure I'll talk more about this tool, called my "Visual Book Designer" within the next few days. Maybe I'll even post up some pictures of the tool in operation! It's a really cool outlining tool that is a far cry better then my previous book design tool.<br /></li><li>I rearranged my room the other day, and I took the cheap wooden frame out from under my futon. The frame was only about 2-3 inches tall, but without it my parents are concerned that I'm "just sleeping on the floor". When I move out, I'm going to throw that old futon away.</li></ol>That's it for now, I'm sure I'll have more to post eventually.
