I have, just now, ironed out the last major bug in my processor model. The feedback paths are working, port input and output are working, everything is going well. I haven't robustly tested everything, and my assembler is still discombobulated, but I'm thrilled with my progress. I want to fix the bugs in my assembler tonight, so that I can write actual code (instead of having to hand-code instructions into binary as I have been doing). After that, it's smooth sailing from here till the finish line.
