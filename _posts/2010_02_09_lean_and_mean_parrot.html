title: Lean and Mean Parrot
---

I'm a big proponent of a smaller, leaner, faster Parrot. I'm probably an extremest in this regard, and I won't deny that label. Here I'm going to try to express my vision for what I think Parrot should be.<br /><br />Parrot has about 1250 ops currently. This is a huge amount by any standards. I haven't seen any such analysis, but I suspect that if we calculated usage statistics for them under normal operating loads that some ops would be used quite frequently, some would be used only occasionally, and a good portion of them would be absolutely unused. Some are used so infrequently that they are little more than a novelty.<br /><br />Each of those ops carries with them a penalty. They use memory (not a lot, to be sure, but non-zero), and they slow down the speed of op lookups in places like IMCC. If searching for a particular op is O(n), then the larger n, the more time a lookup can take. As I've mentioned before in my posts about Lorito, what Parrot really needs is a smaller, more focused op set that is easier to work with from the perspective of the computer.<br /><br />I don't want ops to disappear entirely, they are still a relatively fast way to perform computations. Instead what I would like to see are a larger assortment of dynops that users can load on demand if they need them, and not load them at all if they don't. In an ideal world, I would like to see op libraries like this be moved out of the Parrot repository entirely and managed by a package manager like Plumage. I draw a tight analogy with Perl5's CPAN, and it's hard to argue with a project like that which has seen so much success. Ticket #449 involves moving several random ops to dynops, including trigonometric math ops. Recentky I created a new project on github with the intention of hosting these kinds of ops in an external library. Ticket #1260 is the similar removal of bitwise arithmetic ops. In ticket #1432 I suggested the removal of a wide swath of additional, redundant mathematics ops.<br /><br />http://irclog.perlgeek.de/parrot/2010-02-09#i_1971117
