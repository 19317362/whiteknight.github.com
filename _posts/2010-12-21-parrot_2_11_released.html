---

<p>On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 2.11.0 &quot;At The ROFLBBQ.&quot; <a href="http://parrot.org">Parrot</a> is a virtual machine aimed at running all dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Parrot 2.11.0 is available on <a href="ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases/devel/2.11.0/">Parrot's FTP site</a>, or by <a href="http://parrot.org/download">following the download instructions</a>. For those who want to hack on Parrot or languages that run on top of Parrot, we recommend <a href="http://github.com/parrot">our organization page</a> on GitHub, or you can go directly to the official Parrot Git repo on <a href="http://github.com/parrot/parrot">Github</a>.</p>

<p>To clone the the Parrot Git repo into a directory called 'parrot', use the following:</p>
<pre>
    git clone git://github.com/parrot/parrot.git
</pre>

<p>If you want it to be in a directory other than 'parrot', then just give that as a second
argument to clone:</p>
<pre>
    git clone git://github.com/parrot/parrot.git parrot_foo
</pre>
