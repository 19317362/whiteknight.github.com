I'm busy moving today, so I scheduled a blog post ahead of time to help spur the troops on. PCC is a big deal, last weekend we kicked some serious ass as a design team. People were developing, debugging, testing, talking. It was awesome.<br /><br />This weekend, lets take some advice from one of my favorite internet memes, Courage Wolf:<br /><br /><a onblur="try &#123;parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();&#125; catch(e) &#123;&#125;" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/Ss6GL1X1DRI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/kldvkTmOa7g/s1600-h/Courage-Wolf-20-BITE-OFF-MORE-THAN-YOU-CAN-CHEW-THEN-CHEW-IT17.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/Ss6GL1X1DRI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/kldvkTmOa7g/s400/Courage-Wolf-20-BITE-OFF-MORE-THAN-YOU-CAN-CHEW-THEN-CHEW-IT17.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5390393341872770322" border="0" /></a><br /><br />PCC is a big deal, probably one of the biggest. I can't think of any system that is more central to normal operations in Parrot, except the runcores (and they're much simpler). We've got a big task if we want to completely rewrite PCC from the ground, not only without losing any functionality, but actually adding new features in a sane way. It's big. It's more then we can chew, but we're going to chew it anyway. I have all the faith in the world in our development team.<br /><br />The big question is whether we can chew it before the release. I sincerely hope so, and I know a lot of other people hope so too.
