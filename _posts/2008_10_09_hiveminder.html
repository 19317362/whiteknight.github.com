Today I started playing around with <a href="http://hiveminder.com/todo/">Hiveminder.com</a>, and I'm pretty impressed by it already. I'm a big fan of RT too, so it was easy to sell me on something that Best Practical made.<br /><br />For those who don't know, Hiveminder is an issue tracker or a to-do list. Except it's better then that list you hang on your fridge. First, it's on the internet, and the internet is awesome, right? It lets you group and categorize tasks, make notes about them, schedule due dates and repeated events. I list all the things that I want to do, I say when they are due, and it sends me emails and stuff to remind me.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm going to take this for a spin and see if it works out for me.
