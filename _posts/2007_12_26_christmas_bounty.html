Picked up a lot of cool things for christmas, and made a few people pretty happy while I was doing it. I picked up "Programming Python" from Dana, and now I am learning that language. With some of my gift money, I hit amazon and picked up "Mastering Regular Expressions", "Perl Cookbook", "Advanced Perl Programming", and "Lex & Yacc". These books are going to make for an interesting read, and will help out with some of my own book writing endevours.<br /><br />I got some games too: Mario Galaxy and Metriod Prime 3 are the most notable, but I received a few for the gameboy as well. I feel like i don't have a lot of time to play with my thesis looming on the horizon, so I am hesitant to get started playing them.
