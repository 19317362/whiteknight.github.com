title: Great Summaries
---

It's been quite a busy week for me, and my activity level shows no signs of decreasing again until the new year. So, no substantial blogging from me for a little while.<br /><br />In my absence, I strongly suggest everybody <a href="http://lith-ology.blogspot.com/">check out Lithos' blog</a>. He's been posting excellent weekly summaries of Parrot and Perl6 activity. It's been a great resource for me when I've fallen out of the loop.
