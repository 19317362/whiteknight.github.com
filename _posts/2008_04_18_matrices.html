title: Matrices
---

I did some work last night on my matrix class for Octave. It's going along pretty well although much of my code is pretty sloppy. I stayed up pretty late last night working on it, and the result is not the best looking nor most consistent code I've ever written.<br /><br />I've got basic elements in place. I can create new matrices of any size. I can determine when a matrix is a vector (and I can separate between row and column vectors), I can determine when a matrix is a scalar. I can add two matrices, multiply, subtract. I can negate a matrix, transpose it, or scalar multiply it. I can test two matrices for equality.<br /><br />The next big operation to support is the determinant. However, this is composed of smaller operations which I would need to implement first. Also, there are more then one way to do it:<br /><ol><li>The classic is Laplacian decomposition. This would be relatively easy to implement. I would need to create a function to compute minors, which in turn would require me to compute cofactors. This would be recursive, and would be inefficient for large matrices.</li><li>A better idea would be LU decomposition. This would require me to write up gaussian row operation functions, row reduction algorithms, and a simple trace.</li><li>Also good would be QR decomposition, which would provide a good head start for eigen decomposition later on. This would require an implementation using either gram-schmidt orthonormalization, householder reflections, or givens rotations. Gram-schmidt would probably not be too difficult since I already have vector dot-products (but no vector 2-norms yet).<br /></li></ol>Either option two or 3 would be good, and the sub-steps would set me up nicely for later work on eigen decomposition or matrix inversion. Of course, we are getting to the point where I may want to do the rest of the development work using Octave and not PIR as I have been doing. Between me and that goal, however, is integrating this new matrix class into the octave parser.<br /><br />I'm not planning to do any of the rest of this today, or even next week because of the final cleanup work that I need to do on my thesis source code. I have to clean some of the code up (add a lot of comments which are sorely needed), and work out a few kinks. Ideally, this won't take me too too long
