title: MediaWiki PeerReview Extension
---

Yesterday I put the code public for the new <a href="http://github.com/Whiteknight/mediawiki-peerreview">PeerReview extension</a> I've <a href="http://wknight8111.blogspot.com/2009/06/wittie-wiki-project.html">been developing</a>. Actually, I've only been completing and putting the finishing touches on the extension after a friend and colleague, Jason, wrote up the initial versions. <br /><br />The request was simple. We want a way for students in a class using MediaWiki to be able to take ownership of a page and be graded based on it's contents. There is a certain disconnect here with the whole open-content philosophy, but this is only for the narrowly-defined classroom setting where we have a central authority (teacher) and a group of editors with particular assignments. This kind of extension would obviously not be used in an open wiki like <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/">Wikibooks</a>, but it could definitely find a happy home in a private wiki used for a class or closed group.<br /><br />The PeerReview extension has several components. The first, and most obvious, is a review form that appears at the top of reviewable pages. When a user logs in and goes to a reviewable page, the review form appears and the user can enter a review. The review consists of a single grade (letter or number, as appears in the DB) and a short comment.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/S7_Z432sqII/AAAAAAAAAKA/Uf9jtU0kBeA/s1600/PeerReviewForm.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/S7_Z432sqII/AAAAAAAAAKA/Uf9jtU0kBeA/s320/PeerReviewForm.png" /></a></div><br /><br />The next component is the idea of a page "owner". A new special page and some database extensions allow a person with sufficient authority (a teacher or administrator) to assign ownership of a page to a student or a group of students. In this way reviews left on a page can be associated with the students who have ownership of that page.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/S7_Z-k65M_I/AAAAAAAAAKI/Yqn_1Fk4S4U/s1600/PageOwner.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/S7_Z-k65M_I/AAAAAAAAAKI/Yqn_1Fk4S4U/s320/PageOwner.png" /></a></div><br /><br />The third, and currently final component of the extension is a simple dashboard-like interface where a user can view lists of reviews that they have given and received.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/S7_aC8WifnI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/kKvGJ-7acgE/s1600/MyReviews.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/S7_aC8WifnI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/kKvGJ-7acgE/s320/MyReviews.png" /></a></div><br /><br />The PeerReview extension is functionally, in the sense that everything that is visible is operational and tested. However, it is still a little bit slim on features right now, and there is a large amount of new development needed to really bring this to the next level of utility and usability. Specifically:<br /><ol><li>A mechanism to associate students together into class groups, with one or more teachers</li><li>An interface for teachers to monitor the reviews given to/from students in their class, including a utility to aggregate reviews into average scores for each student</li><li>An improved API with more flexibility and more configurability</li><li>Improved aesthetics throughout</li></ol>I am continuing development on this as I am able, but I would definitely like to solicit feedback and maybe even find people interested in contributing to the project.
