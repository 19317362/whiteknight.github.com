title: USA Chapters Meeting.
---

We had a long chat today in #wikimedia-chapters about the USA chapters situation. I was there, Delphine, Pharos, and a few other cameo appearances. I was speaking only from the standpoint of a WMF PA planner, not a ChapCom member. I pushed a slightly fanatical agenda, and I know Delphine played devil's advocate a lot. A little bit of role-playing helped us to put a lot of information on the table.  It is going to be a while before the chapcom makes any kind of official statement on the issue of USA chapters, and i certainly can't say anything about it until then.<br /><br />I would like to have more meetings like this in the future, possibly getting more chapter planners, chapter members, board members, and other related people involved. There are a lot of issues to hash out, and the chat today was promisingly productive.
