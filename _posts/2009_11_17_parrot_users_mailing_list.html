title: Parrot Users Mailing List
---

<a href="http://lists.parrot.org/pipermail/parrot-dev/2009-November/003332.html">Received a message from Coke</a> this morning: We have a new mailing list setup specifically for users of Parrot and applications running on top of Parrot. If you would like a place to chat about Parrot without getting sucked into the minutia of the developers mailing list, the parrot-users list might be the thing to look at. <a href="http://lists.parrot.org/mailman/listinfo/parrot-users">Subscription to the list</a> is free and easy.<br /><br />It has also been suggested that all the parrot developers join that list to help answer questions. Hopefully it will be a great place for new Parrot users to go, get help, meet other developers, and get started using our software!
