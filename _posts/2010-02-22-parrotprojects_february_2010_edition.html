title: ParrotProjects: February 2010 Edition
---

I haven't posted a ParrotProjects update in a while, but that doesn't mean development of new projects has slowed down at all. Quite the contrary, there are plenty of new projects popping up left and right.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">Fun</span><br /><br />I can't speak towards how enjoyable it might be, but <a href="http://github.com/TiMBuS/fun">Fun</a> is an implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_%28programming_language%29">Joy language</a> on Parrot. It's still early in development, but it is exciting to have more functional languages targetting Parrot like this.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">Digest-Dynpmcs</span><br /><br />The Parrot repo currently contains a few dynamic PMCs (dynpmcs) for calculating digests such as MD1, MD4, MD5, and various SHA sums. It has been decided that these kinds of things should find a new home, so our own enterprising developer darbelo has forked them to a new <a href="http://gitorious.org/digest-dynpmcs/digest-dynpmcs">home on Gitorious</a>. Copies of these PMCs are still in the repo pending a deprecation cycle, but after the 2.3 release they will only live on Gitorious.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">ParrotSDL</span><br /><br />If you need to write any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer">SDL applications</a>, you might be excited to hear that bindings for the multimedia library for Parrot are in <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/parrotSDL">active development</a>. ParrotSDL is still a new project and is navigating through some difficulties with Parrot's NCI system. The lead developer, Parrot newcomer kthakore, is also working on SDL <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl">bindings for Perl5</a>, so he's very familiar with the whole system.<br /><br />kthakore is looking for PIR coders to help with the project. Chat about ParrotSDL and the Perl port happens at <a href="irc://irc.perl.org/#sdl">irc://irc.perl.org/#sdl</a><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">NQ-NQP</span><br /><br />You might think of <a href="http://github.com/perl6/nqp-rx">NQP</a> as being a language that only runs on Parrot, but you'd be wrong. Developer ash_ has been working on a <a href="http://github.com/ashgti/nq-nqp-rx">variant of NQP</a> that runs on top of <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> instead. This compiler, which is not quite NQP, is a very interesting project and may help to inform our future  use of LLVM for <a href="http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/JITRewrite">Parrot's JIT system</a>.
