title: Weekend Wedding

Last night Dana, her family, and I went to her cousin's wedding. Because of a lot of intra-family drama, which I won't discuss in any detail here, I expected that the wedding was going to be a disaster. In some ways I was right, and in other ways I was not. Of course, it's not the purpose of this blog to criticize people's weddings, so I won't do that here either.<br /><br />After the wedding, we went out to Chick-Fil-A, and we must have been some of the best-dressed people who ever went in there. A nice sandwich and some of those fries really hits the spot, though.<br /><br />I'm here at Dana's house through tomorrow, staying an extra day to help Dana set up her passport. We booked our honeymoon yesterday morning, going to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico. We got a decent deal too, and came in under budget (which is refreshing!).<br /><br />Parrot had a bug-a-thon yesterday which I wasn't able to participate in. Saturdays are always bad days for me to do anything programming-related. With the next release coming out on Tuesday, I probably won't be able to do any meaningful bug work. In penance, I'll work extra hard to get set up for my GSoC project.<br /><br />I have a few other projects that I want to get working on too: First, I want to start porting my Wiki-bot program over to Gtk instead of Tk. I also want to try to expand the bot to do page moves, and possibly page deletions. I also want to try to do some work on my Octave port, if I can find the time. Time, of course, is always the limiting reagent.
