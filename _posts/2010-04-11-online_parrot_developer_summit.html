For anybody who hasn't heard the news, the <a href="http://wknight8111.blogspot.com/2010/04/parrot-virtual-developer-meeting.html">Parrot online developer summit</a> is starting in about 10 minutes from the time I am writing this blog post. By the time this post circulates through various aggregators and feed readers, it will be start time.<br /><br />Hope to see lots of people there today! Definitely make sure to stop by the IRC chatroom, even if you only want to lurk and not participate.
