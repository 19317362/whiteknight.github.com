title: GSoC&#58; The Contenders
---

The GSoC applications deadline came and went today at 19:00 UTC, and we have received quite an impressive crop of proposals from prospective students. I don't know how many slots Google will give to the Perl Foundation, and of those I don't know how many will be devoted to Parrot. However, even if only a few of the proposals we received get final approval it will be a great year for Parrot. Some students did submit multiple applications, and at least one student that I am aware of also submitted applications to other organizations, so even under the best circumstances we won't be getting all of the projects below approved and started.<br /><br />Anyway, I would like to briefly describe the proposals we have received. I can't go into too much detail because we're entering a period of feedback and revisions, but I can give the gist of what has been proposed.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">GMP Bindings for Parrot - Robert Kuo</span><br /><br />Robert, better known on IRC by the handle "bubaflub" has been a Parrot contributor for a while now. He has submitted two proposals to Parrot, both of which look quite interesting. His first proposal, proper bindings for the venerable GMP library, is related closely to some of the rantings and ravings I've made previously on this very blog. <br /><br />There are two premises behind this project:<br /><ol><li>The BigInt and BigNum libraries don't really belong in the Parrot core distribution</li><li>The GMP library has a large amount of power and utility that these two PMC types don't even begin to expose</li></ol>Another big benefit here is that GMP bindings can be quite intensive for a new runtime, so if they are done properly in Parrot they could be made immediately available to all languages running on Parrot for free. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">A PAST Optimization Framework for Parrot - Tyler Curtis</span><br /><br />Tyler, "tcurtis" on IRC, is a Parrot newcomer. He originally showed some interest in my Immutable Strings project idea, but has since been steered in the direction of adding an optimization framework for PAST. Personally I'm happy he made the switch.<br /><br />This is another project that I've discussed at length on my blog, and I'm very happy somebody has taken up the challenge of it. A robust and extendable optimization framework would allow other people to quickly and easily write new optimizations. The framework is much more important in this regard than any individual optimization is. Of course, the proposal is also sort of open-ended: Once the framework is in place, Tyler can devote his energy to adding new optimization stages to it from an endless list of possibilities. For this reason, this is one of those projects where we won't be asking "when will he finish?" , but instead we will ask "how much will he complete before time is up?".<br /><br />The real power here is adding the optimization framework to PAST, which many (though not all!) of our compiler projects use. In this way, optimizations added once can be immediately used by several compilers. Write once, make faster everywhere. It's quite a compelling project for the performance-weary among us, and it looks like chromatic is quite keen to mentor this one if it gets accepted.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Hybrid Threads for Parrot - Nat Tuck</span><br /><br />Threads are another huge issue in Parrot. Our current threading system, while technically "existing" is so messy, bug-ridden, andÂ  lousy as to be essentially unusable by our various projects. I've said on a number of occasions that Parrot can't really call itself "Production Ready" as our 2.0 release tagline was supposed to be until it has the scalability and performance improvements that a robust threading system provides.<br /><br />Nat Tuck, "Chandon" on IRC, was another person originally interested in Immutable Strings, but has since submitted his application to revamp the threading system in Parrot. It's hard for me to say any other project has the same potential for reward, but it's also hard to say that any other project matches this one in terms of complexity. It's ambitious, to say the least.<br /><br />Threads are an extremely esoteric area of infrastructure development, similar to GC. When they work, they just work and nobody even thinks about them. Your software just "scales" the way people need it to. Plus, anybody can write threading code, but it can be extremely difficult to do it correctly. That's why Parrot getting it's part right is of utmost importance.<br /><br />Nat's general idea is to use a small number of OS threads to host a large number of discrete tasks and virtual "green" threads transparently. He's also looking into fixing some of the bugs in cloning interpreters that stymie the current threading system and would make implementation of the new system more difficult.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Improvements to the NCI System and LLVM Stack Frame Builder - John Harrison</span><br /><br />John Harrison, also known as IRC regular "ash_", has submitted an interesting and extremely pertinent project proposal for an improved NCI system. The title mentions LLVM specifically, but he's also looking at variants using libFFI. He wants to build a pluggable system with multiple available dynamic frame-builders, and Ahead-Of-Time compliation of frames to save runtime effort.<br /><br />This project isn't as large or ambitious as some of the others, but in return comes higher probability that the system will be polished and thoroughly tested for robustness by the end of the summer. Massive improvements to the NCI system would also provide major benefits to projects writing library wrappers, like some of the other GSoC projects are doing.<br /><br />Chance of success for this project is high, and there are clear benefits to Parrot in having this feature.<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Implementing an Instrumentation Tool for Parrot VM - Muhd Khairul Syamil Hashim</span><br /><br />This project came completely out of left field and is the only one that I never suggested on my blog ahead of time. It's also the only project proposal that came to us with working proof-of-concept code, and the results of that small example already have some of the Parrot developers imagining of all sorts of fancy long-term uses.<br /><br />Muhd, "Khairul" on IRC, is planning a system of hooks and callbacks in Parrot that would allow one interpreter to attach to another interpreter at runtime and harvest information about the system as it executes. By adding the appropriate hooks and writing the correct handling routines, we could end up with all sorts of great tools, such as profilers, analyzers, debuggers, etc. And the best part is that we gain the ability to implement all these fun tools in PIR or even another HLL, not in C like some current tools use.<br /><br />You don't have to think about it for long to understand the benefits of this project: Identifying code hotspots and bottlenecks, analyzing PMC usage patterns, tracking and mapping control flow, and the list goes on. We may even get to a point when we can replace Parrot's current debugging, tracing, and profiling runcores with this single tool and a variety of different PIR programs. Quite fun to think about.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">NFG and Single-Representation for the Parrot VM - Daniel Arbelo Arrocha</span><br /><br />Daniel, everbody's favorite "darbelo" from last year's GSoC fame, has proposed two projects this year. The first is an attempt to implement NFG, a new normalization form for Unicode text strings. The benefits for NFG are a perfect one-to-one mapping between a character and it's underlying representation. This in turn can lead to some significant simplifications in the code of Parrot, and some proposed speedups as well.<br /><br />NFG is one of the few points in the Parrot design spec that has never even been prototyped in working code, that I am aware of. Everything else has at least been given prototype treatment, but NFG remains nowhere to be seen in the actual codebase.<br /><br />Daniel's proposal is to implement NFG in a testbed so that it's performance can be compared to the current string system. If it is a benefit (and we all hope it is!) we can merge it into trunk and start a new era of strings in Parrot. If not, we can continue development on it until it becomes better, or even scrap it entirely. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Parrot on RTEMS - Daniel Arbelo Arrocha</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Parrot on RTEMS - Robert Kuo</span><br /><br />We had two submissions from prospective students with the exact same name. Both darbelo and bubflub have been inspired by dukeleto's work in the area and have proposed to work on the RTEMS port of Parrot. A major portion of this work will be improvements to the cross-compilation capability of our current configuration and build system, improvements which will have many benefits outside RTEMS. In addition, these two are proposing to help improve the operation of Parrot on RTEMS.<br /><br />As far as I am aware, this submissions were both duplicated to the RTEMS people as well, so even if one of these proposals get accepted it's possible that the student will actually be working with an RTEMS mentor instead of a Parrot one.<br /><br />In both cases, I think the alternate proposals for both students look a little more desirable (darbelo's NFG proposal, and bubaflub's GMP proposal), but I've never really used RTEMS so I'm probably biased. I wouldn't definitely not do any crying if one of these "Parrot on RTEMS" projects got accepted, however.
