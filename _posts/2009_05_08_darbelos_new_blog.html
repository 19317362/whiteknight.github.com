title: Darbelo's New Blog
---

Darbelo, the GSOC student that I am backup-mentoring, has <a href="http://www.parrot.org/blog/341">finally started his blog</a>. The blog will be used throughout the summer to post updates about his project. I can say that his progress so far is pretty fantastic, and some initial prototypes of various things are already checked into <a href="http://code.google.com/p/decnum-dynpmcs/">his googlecode repo</a>.<br /><br />It's going to be an interesting project to watch, and the stage is set for a pretty exciting and productive summer.
