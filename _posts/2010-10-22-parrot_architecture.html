title: Parrot Architecture

For anybody who hasn't already seen it, Christoph Otto has started a new blog. As his first post, he talks about the role of architecture, and the passing of the torch from Allison Randal to himself and the newly-formed architecture team.<br /><br />I've had questions about the role and even the necessity of the position of Architect since I joined the Parrot project. I didn't vocalize too many of these because it is kind of rude to join a new community and immediately start questioning some of their basic organizational precepts. Plus, I wouldn't want to start saying things that could be deemed offensive to Allison. She is, as Christoph points out in his post, a very capable leader and an A-list hacker after all.<br /><br />I'm very happy about the creation of the new architecture team. Even if all the rest of the teams are deemed to be superfluous, or to be failures, or whatever, the establishment of the architecture team is a great thing. If nothing else, that move will do a lot to advance Parrot.<br /><br />I think this is finally an opportunity to ask, and answer, some of those questions that I have.<br /><br />We have all read Brook's <i>The Mythical Man Month</i>, and if you haven't, you should. The role of architect in a software team is spelled out pretty clearly in that book. The architect works on things like designs, and high-level specifications, while coders can focus on the best and most practical ways to implement those designs. I've always wondered though, what is the role of the architect in Parrot?<br /><br />As I've pointed out in another recent post, the state of Parrot's design documents is not good. In some cases that may be a bit of an understatement. Is it the role of the architect to draft these documents? To revise and edit them? To approve them? To maintain them? To guide others in these tasks? If we have only a single architect, we obviously have to limit the amount of work required of that person. If we have a team, maybe we can ask a little bit more.<br /><br />What role does the architect play in solving problems and designing solutions? What role does the architect play in designing systems and interfaces where a need has been demonstrated and implementation is about to begin, but for which no formal design has previously been created? Consider the case where an HLL developer comes to us and says "We really need feature X, and we need it as quickly as you can provide it." Do the developers need to wait for the architect to prepare a design, or do we move ahead with an experimental implementation and wait for later approval/redesign from the architect?<br /><br />Do we (developers) need to wait for the architect to green-light proposed new projects? Do we need approval from the architect before merging in large changes that do not correspond to a pre-existing written design? There is obviously some argument to be made for these kinds of things as a way to promote sanity and consistency in the code. There's also the counter-argument to be made that it dis-empowers most developers and dramatically slows down the development process. Linus Torvalds does maintain final say about what does and does not get merged into the master branch of the Linux repo, but he's hardly a part-time volunteer in that role (and he has plenty of help for a cadre of very trusted senior developers). <br /><br />There have been a number of occasions where I personally was delayed, not because I was waiting for input from Allison, but because I wasn't sure if I needed her input or not. There have been other occasions where groups of people were highly motivated to tackle a particular problem, but that motivation slowly died away because there was no design, no idea where the design would be coming from, and no clear vision expressed about how to proceed.<br /><br />I don't blame Allison for any of these delays. If we didn't have an architect at all, maybe the developers would be more empowered to just make decisions. Though we wouldn't have the consistency of vision that an architect can provide, so I don't think we would be any better off. If we have multiple people acting in an architectural role, and a set of norms and explicit policies for how to utilize them, there will be no confusion and we don't have to worry too much about overloading any one person with all the questions of design and minutia that I'm sure an architect might receive.<br /><br />I would like to see two things happen as a result of the new Architectural team's formation. First, I would like to see a clearly-defined vision statement for what the architectural team is responsible for and how it interacts with the rest of the developer community. Second, I would like to see the team begin to improve the Parrot design documentation. Whether the team drafts new versions of the most important documents, or whether it motivates the community at large to do it, does not really matter. Even if the architecture team only works to revamp a handful of design documents at a time, to correspond to current short- and medium-term development goals, that would be a pretty big step up and I think it would have a very beneficial impact
