title: My RPG Game Idea
---

I've always been a huge fan of videogames, and RPGs in particular. I cut my teeth on early Final Fantasy games and grew up with the series, among others. Recently, I was delighted to learn about an open-source entry in the genre, KQ. KQ is incomplete and I found some of the scenarios left something to be desired, but it's an admirable effort (and, a hell of a lot of fun to play).<br /><br />I've been slowly coming up with my own idea for such a game. My idea has been motivated by some of the shortcomings I've always found in the common mechanics of the ones I have played. Let me give a short overview of existing RPG games and then go over my ideas for a new RPG game engine.<br /><br />Every RPG has some unique feature about it, but the core mechanics of them tend to be remarkably similar. You control a team of impossibly goody-goody team members around the world. As you travel, random and unexpected encounters with "monsters" occur, at which point you battle. During battle, you attack the monsters with a combination of weapons and unimaginatively-named magic tricks (Fire 4!) and protect yourself with similar protective spells (Cure 7!).<br /><br />Every combatant has a measure of longevity called HP. When HP reaches 0 the character dies. At which point, they may be miraculously revived from a special magic spell, a special (and oddly-named) inventory item, or by spending some time in a tent or hotel. It's also worth noting that the inventory that your team can carry with them over the mountains and through the woods is virtually limitless: You can carry with you 99 cabins, 99 potions, 99 fire stones, and 99 broad swords without so much as breaking a sweat.<br /><br />Each encounter with the enemy, assuming the contest is decided in your favor, brings with it some rewards: Money (often a fixed amount depending on the species of your foe), random reward prizes, and "experience". Experience builds up in your characters and when a prescribed interval is reached the character gains a "level". Each level, in turn, increases their various specialities, capabilities, and vital statistics.
