title: Busy Week in June
---

It's only Tuesday, and this is already shaping up to be a busy week for me.  That certainly isn't a problem or anything, it's good to stay active.<br /><br />Today was the first weekly #parrotsketch meeting that I had to participate in for my GSOC project. #parrotsketch is a meeting held every tuesday at 2:30 where people give brief reports about their work for the previous week. My report was only a few lines long and was over in less then a minute, but it was thrilling nonetheless.<br /><br />Got my first payment from Google out of the bank today. It's not much (only 500$) but if I stay on a strict budget it should support me for a while. The other students in the program are all talking about doing cool stuff with their money: buying new computers or peripherals, buying music/movies, videogames, etc. Me? I'm subsisting and paying bills. It may not be glamorous, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It's good to have priorities, and it's good to be getting on with life.<br /><br />Thursday, Johnny is in town and we are going to try to do lunch. Summer is his busy month, doing landscaping work (hence is travels to my area) in the mornings and doing farm work in the afternoons. I'm glad to have a chance to get together with him, we talk so rarely anymore because of our conflicting schedules (he's online around 5am, I don't wake up will 8ish).<br /><br />Friday, I've got a technical phone interview lined up at 1pm. I dont want to give out any details yet lest I jinx myself. Rather then gossiping, my time is better spent brushing up on my technical prowess. I hope I don't goof this one up like I did my technical interview with Google! For people who don't know, i had a relatively good interview with them but said, in a moment of sheer ignorance that the UNIX fork command launched a separate process instead of duplicating the current one. I may kick myself forever for that snafu.<br /><br />Beyond those few things, I have the standard cadre of tasks to attend to: more Parrot-related work, blogging,  some cleaning, dealing with the dogs, etc. I also plan, as vaguely as a plan can be, to start some kind of regular exercise regimen. I feel like i've been to lethargic with all the computer hours I've been logging.
