title: Online Safety Book and Course

I'm writing this post in response to a Slashdot article from a few weeks back:<br /><br /><a href="http://it.slashdot.org/it/07/08/17/1333258.shtml">http://it.slashdot.org/it/07/08/17/1333258.shtml</a><br /><br />Which, in turn, is written about a news story:<br /><br />"<a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/News/59257,us-curriculum-to-include-online-safety.aspx">US Curriculum to Include Online Safety</a>"<br /><br />The potential here for Wikibooks and Wikiversity is enormous. A course and an accompanying textbook for online safety would have the potential to help influence a nationwide standard for online safety. How often have we all seen newstories of children being solicited online, or people downloading destructive bugs or viruses from unfriendly websites?<br /><br />This is the kind of thing that many of or tech-savvy members could participate in, talking about avoiding phishing, keeping your computer protected from viruses/spyware/adware, keeping children protected from predators/pornography, etc. I would like to start getting some ideas together on this, and I hope that other people would be interested in helping.
