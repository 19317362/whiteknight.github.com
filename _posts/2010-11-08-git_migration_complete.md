title: Parrot's Git Migration Complete!
Categories: [Parrot, ParrotCommunity, Github]

Parrot's migration to Git is complete. [The new repository][gitrepo] is
available online today at Github.

This migration is due in no small part to the combined efforts of Jonathan
Leto and Christoph Otto, who have been working extremely hard in the past few
months to make it happen. Besides writingd documentation and convincing
naysayers, these two have done a lot of technical work to support the
transition. Christoph did some work on the Git integration plugin for Trac,
and dukeleto has done the lions share of the actual migration. Several other
people did lend a hand as well, but without these two we would not be on
Github today. Kudos to these two, and all the people who helped with the big
migration.

Today starts a brand-new age in the development of Parrot. It is my sincere
hope that Git will help us to get new people involved and to create a more
natural distributed workflow that our community will thrive on. I've already
created [my own fork][myrepo] of the repo, have you?
