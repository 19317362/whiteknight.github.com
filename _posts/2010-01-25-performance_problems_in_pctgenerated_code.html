title: Performance Problems in PCT-Generated Code
---

Yesterday I railed against PIR, which I consider to be a solution in search of a problem ("We have this great language for people who want to use Assembly-level language but would like slightly better syntax!"). Today I'm going to gripe about the way PIR code is generated by tools like PCT.<br /><br />But before I say anything, I want to make one thing clear: I don't criticize things because I hate them and want them to die in a fire. I criticize things because I love them and want to see them get better.<br /><br />To start my little rant, let's consider a snippet of pseudo-HLL-code and a snippet of PIR code that is similar in function to what PCT would generate:<br /><br />function foo () &#123;<br />  local x = 5;<br />  &#123;<br />    local y = 6;<br />  &#125;<br />&#125;<br /><br />.sub foo<br />   $P0 = new ['Integer']<br />   $P0 = 5<br />   .lex "x", $P0<br />   .const Sub foo_inner = 'foo_inner'<br />   'foo_inner'()<br />.end<br /><br />.sub foo_inner<br /> <br />
