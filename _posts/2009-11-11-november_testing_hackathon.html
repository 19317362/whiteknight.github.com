A quick announcement before I forget about it:<br /><br />This weekend, November 14th and 15th, there will be a testing hackathon for Parrot. We want to focus our efforts on improving tests, especially opcode-related tests in t/op/*. Some tasks that we will try to work on are:<br /><ol><li>Converting tests from Perl to PIR</li><li>Improving coverage of tests for ops</li><li>Get lots of platform test reports in anticipation of the 1.8.0 release.</li></ol>I would love to see lots of people on IRC this weekend to help with the festivities.
