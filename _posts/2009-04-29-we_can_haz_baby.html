title: WE CAN HAZ BABY?
---

<span style="font-size:180%;">WE CAN HAZ BABY?</span><br /><br />The answer, as it turns out, is "yes". Dana and I are pleased to announce that we can haz it sometime around late November. Not sure if it's a boy or a girl yet, but we're 9 weeks along, and it has a heart rate of 162. We've been sort of keeping the news to ourselves until today, when we had our first ultrasound appointment. We thought it best to save the good news until we talked to a doctor and saw a strong heartbeat on the monitor.<span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="font-size:100%;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-size:180%;"><br />OMG PIXPLZKTHX?</span><br /><br />Of course, here it is:<br /><br /><a onblur="try &#123;parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();&#125; catch(e) &#123;&#125;" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/Sfi9OzN95JI/AAAAAAAAAHE/PXJUHMnImTQ/s1600-h/399%282%29.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 222px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ztFc4AiNk_k/Sfi9OzN95JI/AAAAAAAAAHE/PXJUHMnImTQ/s320/399%282%29.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5330218220957590674" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">ROFLMAO TTYL!!<br /><br /></span>Of course I'll be talking about it later, I'm sure I'll be posting updates about the new baby...for the rest of my life. Also, Dana was talking about creating a new blog specifically for the kid, so I'm sure lots of information will end up there.
