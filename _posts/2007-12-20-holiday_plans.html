Christmas is here in 5 days, and I am going to be happy when it's over. We are spending the first half of this weekend at my house with my family, and the second half of the weekend, christmas eve, and christmas morning at Dana's house. We're going to try to be at my place for Christmas brunch, which is my parent's big to-do.<br /><br />I don't know what the plan is for New Years, and I almost don't care either way. The New Years we've spent at Dana's tend to be a little boring, but then again when we are here at my house it's too loud to sleep and we need to deal with some sort of party being held by one of my brothers.<br /><br />The week between holidays, and the rest of this break until school starts again, I am planning to get some major work done on my thesis. I've been having some good ideas about it, and I'm feeling confident about it, and so I have high hopes that I'll be able to get a lot of work done on it.
