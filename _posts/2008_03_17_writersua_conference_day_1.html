title: WritersUA Conference. Day 1
---

The plane trip yesterday was a long one, but we made it through with no major problems. No delays, no lost luggage, nothing. It was a long trip though, and one that I'm not interested in repeating any time soon.<br /><br />Portland is a nice place, and I was pleasantly surprised about how nice the city is. It's nicer then Philadelphia, cleaner, quieter, less traffic. I hear tell that the traffic can get much worse around rush hour, but that's to be expected anywhere. I wouldn't mind living or working around here, if such an opportunity arose. I doubt Dana shares that sentiment with me.<br /><br />The WritersUA conference hoopla started yesterday, if you want to get technical, so that would actually make this Day 2. I don't want to get technical, however, so I'm calling this Day 1. I've seen the room that I'm going to be presenting in. It's a relatively small room, probably only 50 chairs or so. I guess I wasn't expecting to fill the entire grand ballroom or anything, and I don't mind presenting to a small crowd. I just hope that I don't end up presenting to an empty room.<br /><br />I met llywrch (Geoff) and his small family the other day, and it was a fun evening out. I had meant to ask him how to properly pronounce his username, but I forgot to. We talked a little bit about wiki. He offered to introduce me to Ward Cunningham, which would have been wonderful to do if I wasn't so pressed for time. His wife was charming, his little baby was absolutely adorable, and the whole experience was one to remember. I love meeting Wikimedians, and Geoff was no exception.<br /><br />I met some people and saw a few product demonstrations, and it amazes me how much some of these professional software applications seem to emulate wikis, or even borrow features of wikis. I had a long conversation with the CEO of Author-It, a company that sells a distributed authoring application which seems remarkably like a wiki to me. Of course, they have a lot more features and polish then our humble software has, but that's to be expected. Nobody would buy a piece of software if the free alternatives were much better.<br /><br />Dana and I went out to a nice restaurant for lunch, Jake's Famous Crabhouse Restaurant, and while it was a little bit pricey, the food and service were fantastic. This is our vacation, after all, so spending a little bit of money on good local fare is just one of those things that needs to get done.<br /><br />I'm doing some networking and exploring this afternoon, and Dana is already looking around for a dinner destination. I'll probably post again tomorrow when I have more to talk about.

                    Andrew, I just found your blog so excuse the delay in commenting. <BR/><BR/>It was also a pleasure to meet you & Dana. One thing you forgot to mention was that we had a problem meeting each other: Andrew & Dana had arrived at the restaurant before us, & had a drink while they waited; we arrived, were seated, & waited about 10 minutes for them. We only connected when Andrew & I separately went outside to call each other -- & I happened to ask him if he was Andrew. <BR/><BR/>I hope you both have a chance to visit Powell's Books, perhaps Portland's best-known attraction. (The only other candidate -- the 24-hour Church of Elvis -- closed about 10 years ago.) The main store is only a few blocks from Jake's. <BR/><BR/>As for how to pronounce my online handle -- llywrch -- the two l's are pronounced in the Welsh fashion. Unfortunately, I've never actually heard that sound (similar to the "ch" in the Scots word "loch"), so like everyone else I pronounce it incorrectly. <BR/><BR/>Geoff
