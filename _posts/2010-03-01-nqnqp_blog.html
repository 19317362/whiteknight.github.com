A few days ago <a href="http://wknight8111.blogspot.com/2010/02/parrotprojects-february-2010-edition.html">I mentioned</a> an interesting new project called NQ-NQP, an implementation of the NQP language with a flex/bison frontend and an LLVM code generating backend. I've heard tonight that he's <a href="http://greaterthaninfinity.com/">started blogging about it</a>. Anybody who is interested in NQP or LLVM stuff might do well to give it a read.
