A few days ago <a href="/2010/02/22/parrotprojects_february_2010_edition.html.html">I mentioned</a> an interesting new project called NQ-NQP, an implementation of the NQP language with a flex/bison frontend and an LLVM code generating backend. I've heard tonight that he's <a href="http://greaterthaninfinity.com/">started blogging about it</a>. Anybody who is interested in NQP or LLVM stuff might do well to give it a read.
