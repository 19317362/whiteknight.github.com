title: Fare thee well, Temple
---

Today is an archetypical example of why I'm not going to miss Temple once I've graduated. I want to clarify up front that I'm not just another disgruntled student, I don't begrudge my time here. It is, however, time for me to leave.<br /><br />The graduate school requires that the thesis be printed on paper that is at least 20lb, at least 25% cotton, and "White" in color. The graduate school website also informs me that the paper I need is available for purchase at the bookstore. So, with all due haste, I travel to the bookstore and buy the four last packs of paper. Sixty dollars, 400 sheets (200 sheets fewer then I needed, but it's a good start). The paper is called "Cranes Thesis Paper". The weight is 24 lbs, the paper is 100% cotton, and the color is listed as "White".  After purchasing the paper, I go back across campus to my office, and load up the graduate school website again to start reading about the next steps in my journey. Upon reading, I notice a footnote that says "Cranes White 100% cotton paper is NOT an acceptable shade of white." Good.<br /><br />I travel back down to the bookstore to return the paper. "Is there anything wrong with it?" the girl behind the counter asks. "Yes", I reply, "it's not the right paper, the graduate school says it's not acceptable for printing a thesis." The cashier is a bit bewildered by this, and points out to me (as if I haven't read it already) the words "thesis paper" on the front of the box. Apparently, it must be a different use of the word "thesis". I'm then informed that the bookstore doesn't have an alternative, the only kind of paper that it carries, it's entire selection, is Cranes thesis paper. "There might be some at the Barnes & Nobel", she suggests.<br /><br />For people who aren't familiar with Temple, there are two bookstores. The first is located in the basement of the student center, and the second is a Temple-affiliated Barnes & Nobel on the other side of broad street. The selection of books at the B&N is smaller then the normal bookstore, and it focuses mostly on law books. It also doesn't have the correct paper, and I've wasted 30 more minutes in the pursuit.<br /><br />I need 6 copies of my thesis printed on good paper. At the time of writing this, I have 3 prepared. I was unable, for lack of "diamond dollars" and good paper to print the rest here. I will have to do it sometime this weekend at Kinkos or something. Two copies, unbound, need to go to the graduate school by Monday May fifth. I was hoping to have them submitted today, but I don't have all the necessary signatures. I can't get the signatures either: while all my professors are known to be on campus today, none of them have been in their offices, or anywhere in plain sight for that matter. I also can't get back in my office now since the floor is being mopped and the cleaning staff have locked me out. That means I can't get my laptop or my bag (so I can't leave early to hit kinkos) and I can't work on any of my final projects. Lucky for me I still have rudimentary blog access.
