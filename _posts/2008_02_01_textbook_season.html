title: Textbook Season
---

Regardless of all my work on Wikibooks, we still aren't at a point yet where when the semester starts I can expect to be downloading the required textbooks for free. However, despite the ridiculous price of modern textbooks, I'm still always a little bit happy when textbook season rolls around. I get a lot of my purchases through Amazon, so I do save some money off the sticker price, and that always helps the situation. It certainly beats giving more of my hard-earned money to Temple.<br /><br />I'm taking a communications-heavy semester (relatively speaking), with both my classes being based in that subject. "Analog and Digital Communications" and "Communications Networks" are likely to have significant overlap in many areas. The latter course is focusing more heavily on particular implementation technologies (WiFi, WiMax, 3G, etc) while the former is going to be more theoretical. I expect to spend a lot more of my life sitting in front of computers running endless numbers of simulations.
