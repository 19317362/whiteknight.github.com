title: Nice day today
---

It's a beautiful day outside, and I spent much of my day wishing I had been in more seasonal attire. Of course, part of that is because my office doesn't have any variant of climate control. When asked to fix that, the maintenance people said that the problem was "probably with the thermostat, or some kind of wiring problem". Needless to say, it still hasn't been fixed.<br /><br />One of my students today had the wonderfully erudite insight: "It's hot as shit out today. We should cancel class so we can go outside and look at hot girls". We will ignore for a moment the course language and the inappropriate topic. We will also ignore, for now, the larger social commentary involving the lack of women in engineering programs, or the glaring example of how young men objectify young women. Beyond these things was the truth: it was indeed a nice day today, and we were all wishing we could skip class to go out and enjoy it.<br /><br />I didn't cancel class, and we as a group did not go outside to enjoy the sun or look at the "hot girls". My youthful exuberance not withstanding, I was aware of the harsh reality: There was work to be done, and all that work needed to be done indoors. When I cam home today, instead of changing into pajamas or other lounge wear as per usual, I put on a pair of breezy athletic shorts. They're just as comfortable for lounging in, but without the unnecessary thermal retention. I may still spend a few minutes out in the afternoon sun while I still have the opportunity, but today is a day of work and tonight is shaping up to be no better.
