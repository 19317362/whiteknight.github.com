title: Lex & Yacc
---

got my new book "Lex & Yacc" today in the mail, and I'm excited about it. I've wanted this book for  a long time now, but I've either never seen it at B&N, or when I have seen it I've been appalled by the price. Lucky for me, I picked it up on Amazon for 10$, including shipping. not bad for a book that is ordinarily 30$ (despite being over 12 years old).<br /><br />The book is certainly interesting, and I am going to use it as a resource to help me beef up some of the books on Wikibooks such as the compiler book. I'm also going to learn as much as I can about these so that I can port those lessons to Perl's Parse::Lex and Parse::Yapp modules. My C days are basically over, and besides some stuff for school and work, I would like to do my coding in higher-level languages from now on.<br /><br />2 more books to go, I hope they show up this week or early next week.
