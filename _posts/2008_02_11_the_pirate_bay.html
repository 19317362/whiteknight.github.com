title: The Pirate Bay
---

I was working on a homework assignment for my communication's class today that was a total pain. The task was to simulate a highly-contrived form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duobinary_signal">duobinary signaling</a> (that wikipedia article is very short and highly inaccurate, and if this weren't the week from hell I would already have updated it). Frustrated because my output signals weren't correlating, and I couldn't find an algorithm to decode it, I went off to google reader to read some news stories.<br /><br />Today being like any other ordinary day, there was a story about thepiratebay.org, and the mountains of legal problems that group find themselves in. For those who don't know (as if anybody in the world doesnt), The Pirate Bay is a group based out of Sweden, that helps to distribute copyrighted materials. I say "helps" here for a very important reason, which I will discuss later. To preface this discussion, I feel it prudent to mention that I am not a file pirate. I do not and have never used thepiratebay.org to obtain any files, much less illegal ones. I do not download, illegally or legally, copyrighted videos or music files.<br /><br />I went to The Pirate Bay to see what it was all about. Here is what I have learned:<br /><ol><li>They are based in Sweden, so US or UK copyright laws do not apply to them.<br /></li><li>Sweden, apparently, has a relatively relaxed attitude towards file sharing, as The Pirate Bay apparently is not in violation of any Swedish laws.</li><li>thepiratebay.org does not itself host or distribute any files. This part is key. The website is a very large bittorrent tracker that members may use to distribute files. In other words, thepiratebay.org isn't hosting and sharing illegal files, they are simply giving easy access to other individuals who are sharing and hosting those files.<br /></li></ol>Now, I'm a big fan of Bittorrent, at least when it is used legally and legitimately. It's an altruism protocol, in that helping other people save some bandwidth is built into the system. When you use Bittorrent, you are helping other people, and you don't have to do a thing. It's this kind of stuff that people really get behind, because people generally like to do nice things for other people, so long as they don't have to go to any special effort to do it. It's akin to "Whenever you buy this product that you buy anyway, for the same price that it's always been, we're going to donate some profit to charity!". It's a round-about way of saying "Do what you do normally, and we'll do something nice on your behalf". Altruism without having to lift a finger, who doesn't love that?<br /><br />Bittorrent is just as simple: Download that file you were going to download anyway, and in the background the bittorrent program will use your bandwidth to upload that same file to other users. Thus, all the users contribute a little bit of bandwidth, and the main server can save itself some strain. It's sort of like contributing bandwidth, it's sort of like hosting a mirror, and you don't have to do anything special besides click "download". For things like large programs, torrenting is really ideal: Linux distros, large software distros, and other large downloads are really ideally suited to torrenting. The community is willing to help mitigate your server bandwidth, so long as they don't have to do anything special. If you build altruism into the system, people will use it and will be happy about it.<br /><br />I read a few of the pages on thepiratebay.org, but I didn't even look at any of the available torrents (tempt me not ye devils!). The About page was very informative, and I like the fact that they have a strict policy concerning filenames. How many times have I wished that files were named more accurately and descriptively from legitimate download sites! I went to their page with various "Legal Threats" they've received, and their responses to such threats. I thought that most of the responses were short, dissatisfying, and immature. However, I also thought that many of the threat emails were poor too. You should have a serious talk with your legal team if they are sending DMCA take-down notices to a Swedish company.<br /><br />On a side note, I've just scheduled my presentation here at Temple. I have a room reserved at 12:40-1:30 for March 5th.
