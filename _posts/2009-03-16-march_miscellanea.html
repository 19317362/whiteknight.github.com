Picked up a parking ticket yesterday in the city. 36$ is enough of a reason for me to just stay the hell away from there as much as I can. It's not like my money is paying for the city to get any cleaner, or is helping to decrease the murder rate or anything.<br /><br />The reason for going into the city was to have a Wikimeetup. I wrote about that on my Wikibooks blog, so no sense to rehash it here. We've tentatively scheduled a "Wikis take Philadelphia" photo scavenger hunt event for 16 May, I'm sure I'll post more details as they surface.<br /><br />I already know one thing that <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/wikipedia.366911876">I want for christmas</a>.<br /><br />Tomorrow is the big 1.0 release for Parrot. I haven't done any developing for it in about a month, focusing instead on my M-on-Parrot compiler Matrixy. It's coming along quite well so far, and hopefully it won't be too long till we're on a regular release schedule ourselves.<br /><br />Tonight I made a great salad with sauted garam-masala chicken and blood orange vinagrette. It's still amazing to me how we can eat like royalty for such little money and effort. Of course, we're probably going to follow it up tomorrow with some hamburger helper. Hamburger helper can be good sometimes too.
