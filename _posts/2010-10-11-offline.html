I've been mostly offline for the past few days. I've been pretty busy and don't have the time to keep up with things the way I would like. There's been a bit of a nexus of things happening all at once:<br /><br /><ol><li>My father has been in the hospital with a pretty serious illness. This has been eating up most of my time and my concentration</li><li>I'm moving to a new job. I'll post more details later</li><li>My kid is teething and has a bit of a stomach bug. He's just a little bundle of joy.</li><li>My dev laptop is broken and disassembled. I'm waiting for new unbroken hinges to be shipped in from Hong Kong. Apparently they are shipping it by camel.</li></ol>I'll have more blog posts to write and more code to commit when things calm down a little bit.
