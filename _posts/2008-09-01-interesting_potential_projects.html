title: Interesting Potential Projects
---

There are two interesting project ideas that I would like to try my hand at eventually, as I get more free time:<br /><br />1) <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2008-August/002670.html">Closures for C</a>? It's an interesting idea that is being developed elsewhere. I would love to find a way to add this, as some kind of optional parser mixin, to Parrot's C implementation. I could copy the syntax that's being used for this in Clang and llvm-gcc, to increase interoperability with those projects<br />2) Alternate Syntax for C++, which has been developed by none other then Damian Conway. I would love to see this implemented as an alternate parser for C++, which could share almost everything (except the parser) with a "standard" C++ implementation. Implementing both in parallel would be very fun (and if I could combine with #1 and give C++ some closures too, that would be hot).
