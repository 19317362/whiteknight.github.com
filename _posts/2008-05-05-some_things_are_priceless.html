title: Some things are priceless

"The good paper": 50$<br />6 copies: 60$<br />Binding 4 copies: 80$<br />Having your thesis accepted by the graduate school: Priceless.<br /><br />What's ironic is that my debit card is actually a mastercard. I dropped off two copies of my thesis today at the graduate school and four copies at the library for binding. I have all the signatures I need, and that should be it. I can never discount the possibility of an eleventh-hour phone call "we have a big problem", but barring such an event I'm primed for graduation.
