I've set up a personal homepage for myself using <a href="http://wknight8111.googlepages.com/">Google Pages</a>. Google is becoming a very interesting part of my life, because it gives me an unprecedented level of integration between my blogging, email, documents, etc. There are a few issues where I wish things were slightly better integrated, but that's really a small complaint.<br /><br />If Google's servers go down, I'm going to be blasted back to the stone age. It's a risk I'm willing to take though.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> I just want to make a mention after the fact that I don't work for Google, nor do I have any hope that I ever will (not for lack of applications, of course). I was a blogspot member before it was taken over by Google, and I've been upset with Hotmail for as long as I can remember. I also used to have a page at Geocities, but it was a pain in the butt to maintain, I didn't like the intrusive ads, and I also didn't like the Geocities page editor (although it may have been improved since I last updated over there). Using Google Pages and Google Documents isn't because I'm a die-hard Google fan (although I am slowly drifting in that direction). but instead because I suddenly have a lot of convenient links right in front of me when I do things I was doing anyway.
