Okay, so it's not quite final, but we are one week away from the next release, and I'm the release manager. I'm already <a href="http://lists.parrot.org/pipermail/parrot-dev/2009-June/002345.html">starting my preparation for it</a>. We only have a week left, and I requested that major changes not land into trunk after Saturday, but I have high hopes that a lot of cool new things will happen soon.<br /><br />I asked on the list that people try to focus on a few major tasks for the release:<br /><ol><li>Update the NEWS and PLATFORMS files. Specifically, there are several platforms that haven't been updated since 2008, and it would be awesome to get them updated.</li><li>Priorities: HLL interop is on the roadmap for this release as being a high-priority item. Also, several developers have asked for better profiling tools. I have offered a bounty of <span style="font-weight: bold;">one batch of brownies</span> (chocolate or blonde, by request) for the first person to deliver good PIR-level profiling tools, before Saturday (when I requested big changes not be made any more). Write a good code profiler, <span style="font-weight: bold;">get free brownies</span>. Can't beat that.</li><li>There are some items in Deprecated that were eligible in 1.1. If some of those could disappear, awesome.</li><li>Documentation.</li><li>Close tickets.</li><li>Blog!<a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/parrotsketch/2009-06-09#i_1225803"> Coke requested at #ps today that people blog about their progress </a>on Parrot to help spread the message and build some interest in the progress.</li></ol>The io_rewiring branch landed in trunk today and appears to have exposed a transient heisenbug. <a href="http://modernperlbooks.com/mt/index.html">chromatic</a> found a reliable way to reproduce it, so now it's just a matter of time before one of the great Parrot minds finds the cause and resolves it. Next on the IO agenda is another branch to do some <a href="/2009/05/26/lots_of_io_work_to_do.html.html">more cleanup and optimizations</a>, and to do more integrating of Socket and Pipe PMC types into the IO API. Following that, I want to kick off the <a href="/2009/05/24/blocked_tasks_and_starting_aio.html.html">AIO work</a> I've been planning.<br /><br />Allison committed her remaining local changes to the pcc_rewiring branch, and I'm hoping that a few eyes looking over it will help resolve the remaining problems. I doubt we'll get the branch merged into trunk before the Tuesday release, but I do hope we can get it committed not long thereafter. Once that branch finally lands, I'll be ready to start on <a href="/2009/05/10/turning_contexts_into_pmcs.html.html">Garbage Collectable Contexts</a>, which I've been planning for a long time too.<br /><br />Cotto sent me a <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/inferno/concurrent_gc/">link today to a cool GC-related research</a> paper that I have already gotten some fun ideas from. I don't know when I'll have time to do any GC work, but I can't wait too long: It's on <a href="/2009/05/22/my_personal_roadmap_for_parrot_20.html.html">my task list for 2.0</a>.<br /><br />So thats the pre-1.3 release recap, plus a little extra information too. Here's hoping things go smoothly from here on out.

        Who is responsible for having a proper threads implementation in Perl6 ? Parrot or Rakudo ?

        Good question Stefan. Parrot is supposed to provide all the basic functionality that languages will need, but the compiler itself is responsible for the particular implmentation. Parrot provides a threading API, Rakudo uses that API to produce it's own threading commands and primitives.<br /><br />So in short, it's 50/50. Parrot has a threading system in place now, but it needs some cleaning and various improvements. I think it provides enough now to implement a basic threading system, but I don't know what all is necessary to completely support Rakudo's needs.
