title: YAPC&#58;&#58;NA
---

It's official, I'm going to <a href="http://yapc10.org/yn2009/index.html">YAPC::NA</a> this year. I had been planning on it for a while, but finally this morning I managed to buy my ticket and reserve my room.<br /><br />I reserved a room for Sat, Sun, and Mon nights. I'll be coming home Tuesday afternoon. I'm going to try like hell to get there by 9AM so I can make the whole <a href="http://yapc10.org/yn2009/talk/2045">PVM workshop</a>. It will be cool to finally meet some of these people!<br /><br />I'm going to be driving from Philly to Pittsburg, so in the unlikely event that somebody else wants to carpool let me know.
