Dana mentioned a while back that I hadn't been updating my blog. I actually have written a number of posts this week, but haven't published any of them.  It's a case of me starting to write something long before I realize how disinterested I am in writing about it.<br /><br />A blog really demands a theme, otherwise it's hard to find things to write about. I have good success writing regular posts in my Wikibooks blog, and I do pretty well in my Parrot-related blog too. This blog is more like a diary, where I write things when I have something to say, but have a hard time forcing myself to update otherwise. Such is life.<br /><br />Dana and I have talked about starting a food-related blog, something where we could take our various dinner creations and upload pictures and recipes. It would be a great way for the two of us to work together on a project, and the theme will help us to stay motivated with it. I do pride myself on my cooking, and a blog would be a great way to show that off to the world. I'm nothing if not a little arrogant!<br /><br />In other blog-related news, the Wikimedia Chapters committee is talking about starting a new blog for themselves to keep the greater Wikimedia community abreast of the committee's doings. Actually, I was talking about doing it because blogging is my thing, and a few other people have shown some support for the idea. I do also run a personal blog for chapters-related topics, but that one doesn't always get updated as regularly as I would like. I have invited some people from the New York chapter, or the Canada planning group to join the blog and post, but so far there has been very little success on that front.<br /><br />I have been thinking about moving away from my use.perl blog and creating yet another personal blog to talk about programming and software topics that are of interest to me. It makes sense because most of my programming projects are not Perl-related, at least not directly. I'm not sure if that's going to happen or not.
