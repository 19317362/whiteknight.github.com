title: Calling All Mac Users
---

A quick shout-out to any developers out there who are using a Mac. Parrot has some outstanding problems on Mac OS 10.4 (I hear the problems are gone in later versions, but have not confirmed).<br /><br />If you have a Mac, preferrably running 10.4 or older, we could use your help:<br /><ol><li>Set up an automatic test bot, so we can get up-to-date test reports on your platform</li><li>See if you are able to fix some outstanding bugs and get Parrot to build and install on your system</li><li>If you can't fix problems yourself, I would like to ask if you are willing to grant shell access to myself or another Parrot dev who could try.</li><li>If you have old, unused Mac machines laying around, maybe you would consider making a hardware donation to the Parrot Foundation so we can start setting up our own dedicated build/test machines.</li></ol>Once we get Parrot building and installing properly on all Mac versions, we'll be able to put out proper packages for end-users to download and install.

                    Whiteknight:  I have no problem building on Mac OS X 10.4.11 on PPC.  IIRC, problems have been reported on 10.4 on Intel.
