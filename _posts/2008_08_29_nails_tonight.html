For my birthday, Dana surprised me with tickets to an NIN concert. The concert is tonight, and I'm waiting for Dave to get here so we can hit the road. The weather is lousy, but I'm not letting that get me down. I'm heading out to Dana's tomorrow morning for the three-day weekend. We got the delux package too: catered box seats, preferred parking, the works.<br /><br />Got paid yesterday too, and payday is always the best. Unfortunately, since I only get paid once a month, these moments are few and far between. My next job will  <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> pay monthly (I've said that at least once before), but I dont know when this mythic next job is going to appear.<br /><br />I'm off now to eat and prepare.
