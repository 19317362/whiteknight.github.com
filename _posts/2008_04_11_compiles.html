title: Compiles!
---

i'm happy to say that my system now compiles and simulates error free. This means that I've got all the data type and rate issues ironed out and all the feedback paths properly initialized. It's earlier in the day then I was expecting to be at this point.<br /><br />The next step, of course, is to try to load some software onto my little chip and see if it performs like it should. This could either go very well or--as I'm expecting--very poorly. Barring worst case scenarios, I'm on track for Monday.
