It's Christmas Eve, and I have some time on my hands because Dana is at work and I have nothing better to do. Once I get around to showering, I'll probably do what I can to help Dana's mom with her dinner preparations.<br /><br />I don't have anything yet for a new years resolution, but there are a few things that I want to consider:<br /><ol><li>Being better organized, probably by making better use of my PDA, and various calendars/scheduling programs, etc. Set up comprehensive to-do lists, for school, work, wiki, life, etc.<br /></li><li>Find a "real job".</li><li>Update all my passwords/security measures to be more secure. Considering the importance of my email account, I might want to get onto a system of regularly changing my email password for maximum security. Other passwords, especially those that rely on my email address can use a static password.</li><li>Change to Linux.<br /></li><li>Publish a paper or two, or three.<br /></li><li>Finish my thesis, graduate.</li></ol>This is just a partial list, of course.
