title: Closing the Hotmail Account
---

I haven't used it in months really, but I've been keeping my hotmail account around because I still occasionally got mail sent there from people who haven't updated their contacts. Well, today I finally <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/10/trove_of_hotmail_passwords_pos.html?hpid=news-col-blog">got a good reason to just go ahead and close the account</a>. So I did that.
