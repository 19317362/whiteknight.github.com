title: Ubuntu Karmic Stability Problems
---

It's not a secret that I've been suffering with all manner of stability problems since I upgraded my laptop to Ubuntu Karmic Koala. I didn't talk about it much here on my blog because I don't fancy myself to be much of a complainer. Plus, I knew the release was still young and people were working on the issue.<br /><br />In general, I can be very patient about software issues if I know somebody is working on them, and from the bug reports I saw in my various searches I was convinced that people were working on them. But it's been several weeks now, several weeks where I cannot get more than an hour of continuous uptime on my laptop on average, and I'm starting to lose my patience.<br /><br /><br />
