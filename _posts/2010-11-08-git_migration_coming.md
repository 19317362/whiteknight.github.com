title: Parrot's Git Migration Coming Soon
---

Just a short heads-up this morning: Parrot's git migration could be happening
soon. An email was sent out to the `parrot-dev` mailing list yesterday
afternoon but due to infrastructure problems the message has not yet been sent
to email recipients. I do not think the git migration will happen until
an email has been successfully sent to the list with adequate preparation time,
but if you do not see an email and are having problems working with Parrot's
SVN repository, please check in with somebody via personal email or on IRC
(or even in the comments of this blog post!) to see what's going on.

I will replace this post with an update when we know more.
