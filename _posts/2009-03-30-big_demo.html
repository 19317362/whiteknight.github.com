title: Big Demo

It's been quiet a busy week, and I've been slacking on my blogging because of it.<br /><br />Work has been eating up a lot of my time, culminating in an important demonstration today for one of the company VPs. Everybody has been working overtime in the past week trying to get things in place so everything. Far from feeling abused and downtrodden, I'm actually energized by the whole experience. We needed to pull together as a team to meet a tough deadline, and in the end we produced some really spectacular results.<br /><br />Dana's been a little sick lately, with reoccurring mono and an ear infection. I'm starting to come down with a little touch of something myself. We're heading to the doctor tomorrow, and have been taking loads of vitamins, so I hope it all goes away soon.
