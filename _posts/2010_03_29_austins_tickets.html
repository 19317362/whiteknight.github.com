title: Austin's Tickets.
---

Austin, of Kakapo and Close fame, has been creating new tickets avidly as he develops his various projects. I asked him to put together a prioritized list of his various tickets so I could focus my attentions fixing bugs that would benefit him the most. Without much delay, he complied. Here's a truncated list:<br /><pre> </pre><pre>Priorities<br />1 = blocking something;<br />2 = not blocking, but I strongly feel this is needed;<br />3 = nice to have;<br />4 = I'm not sure of the status.<br /><br />ticket priority summary<br /><strike>1497 1 Expose 'meth_cache' attribute of class.pmc</strike>1492 1 Get_class namespace) confuses NSes that have same final name.<br /><strike>1473 1 Handle PMC type is broken</strike><br />1520 1 P6metaclass cannot derive from already-`register`ed PMC type<br />1429 2 Add -L support to parrot-nqp<br />1515 2 Duplicate named args cause fatal error in subs<br /><strike>1133 2 MMD matching does not match 'scalar' with primitive types</strike><br />1448 2 Modify `throw` opcode to pass through pre-configured resume continuation<br />1514 2 NQP-rx doesn't check storage mode for contextuals<br />1510 2 NQP-rx doesn't create PMC for string // expressions<br />1464 2 NQP-rx doesn't handle bare "return" from nested block correctly.<br />809 2 Opcode 'isa' does not accept RSA PMC for class<br />1431 2 Register assigned to .local string variable is mis-remembered<br />1430 3 Change trace offset numbers to hex format<br />799 3 Configure should explicitly check for symbolic link capability on Linux<br />1138 3 Create a 'vivify' opcode<br />1455 3 Exception 'birthtime' attribute not accessible<br />1446 3 Exception PMC 'clone' does not work<br />1088 3 Multidispatch 'concatenate_str' does not handle LHS undef<br />1109 3 MultiSub PMC does not support get_namespace method<br />1512 3 NQP-rx generates bad access code for non-twigiled attribute<br />1308 3 NQPrx does not vivify globals in all cases<br />1107 3 Opcode get_class has failed assertion with garbage input<br />1481 3 P6metaclass.register does not catch second registration of PMC Class<br />1437 3 pbc_dump: don't skip varargs words in -d mode<br />1438 3 pbc_dump: Indicate sub/method boundaries in -d mode<br />1065 3 PGE should emit inline PIR with Grammar namespace<br />741 3 PIR line numbers in backtraces are substantially wrong.<br />816 3 PMC 'Undef' does not support logical_not<br />1273 3 Provide a parrot 'backtrace' with assertion failures.<br />1442 3 Sub PMC should support getattribute<br />1513 3 Test::Builder formats TODO tests wrong/poorly<br />1439 3 pbc_dump: Mark branch targets in -d mode</pre><br /><br />I've crossed out the tickets I've already closed, and there are about a half-dozen more that I suspect will be closed within the next week. I'm trying to find the domain experts for some that I don't feel comfortable/competent to close myself.<br /><br />I would like to see all of these get resolved not just for the benefit of Kakapo, but for the good of Parrot in general.

                    I love that you've posted this up here - I'm pointing to it now in irc. But #1492 needs a newline up there...
