The web application I am building at work is broken down into a number of pieces, as we would expect any modern web app to be. We have a database backend (itself fed by another large data gathering application), a series of WCF web services to gather data from the database, and a Silverlight client application. It's a pretty standard setup, and at every stage we are trying to use modern best practices to help keep things maintainable for the forseeable future.<br /><br />In the WCF services component we're using the ADO.NET Entity framework as our ORM.
