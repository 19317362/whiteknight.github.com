<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I just picked up<a href='http://www.scribefire.com/'> ScribeFire</a>, a blogging extension for FireFox. This is my first post with it (so if it turns out lousy, we know who to blame). I'll probably be using this to do all my blogging from now on. I don't have time to blog about it more today, this is mostly a test to see if/how it works. <br/></div>
