We are currently in the "community bonding period", a time when we are getting
to know the students and they are getting to know us as well. We've been
bombarding them with information and a long laundry list of requirements for
the summer already. It's a lot to absorb at first, but we hope that having all
the extra information available up front will help everybody get started more
quickly.

One of the requirements is that the students *must* set up a blog on
[parrot.org][], and must blog there at least once per week. For anybody
who is interested in the progress of these projects, that will be a great
source of information. I will post links here once these blogs start getting
set up.

The coding period begins on [24 May][timeline], just under a month from today.
Coding continues until the end of the summer on 22 August. I look forward to
seeing what some of these students are capable of doing, and I am excited to
think about where we will be as a community, come September when GSoC is over
and most (hopefully all!) of these projects are wildly successful. I think we
will be in a very good place indeed.
