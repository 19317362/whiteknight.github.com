title: Perl 6 Microgrant
---

Got news today that my application for a Perl 6 Microgrant has been accepted. <a href="http://use.perl.org/%7Eacme/journal/38274">Here's</a> the announcement, and <a href="http://use.perl.org/%7EWhiteknight/journal/38275">here's</a> my first post about it. I'll be posting updates on my <a href="http://use.perl.org/%7EWhiteknight/journal/">use.perl blog</a> and not here.<br /><br />The microgrant isn't huge money (the "micro-" prefix in front of it should indicate that), but it is a cool opportunity for me to do some important work with a carrot dangled in front of my face and get some publicity for both Perl 6 and Wikibooks. I'll post more details about the grant and my work for it later.
