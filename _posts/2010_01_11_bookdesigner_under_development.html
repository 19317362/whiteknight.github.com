title: BookDesigner Under Development
---

I had been putting it off recently because it was "good enough" and I had other items on my todo list with higher precidence. However recently I've spent a few hours working on my <a href="http://github.com/Whiteknight/mediawiki-bookdesigner">MediaWiki Book Designer extension</a>, and I'm starting to make some real progress with it.<br /><br />As a bit of history, I started working on the designer when I was an active <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Whiteknight">Wikibookian</a>. It was born from my experience helping new users to get started writing books at <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org">Wikibooks</a>, which ended up being unnecessarily complicated. The MediaWiki software is primarily developed and targeted for use with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, not Wikibooks after all.<br /><br />A graphical book outlining tool was one of the major deliverables requested from my contract with the <a href="http://wknight8111.blogspot.com/2009/06/wittie-wiki-project.html">Wittie group</a>, and I was already mostly finished working on the first version of it on Wikibooks. As part of my work on the Wittie project, I slimmed the designer tool down to an easy-to-use subset of features, made a few improvements to the UI, and even wrote up a proper PHP backend to it that I didn't have access to do at Wikibooks.<br /><br />Not too long ago I <a href="http://wknight8111.blogspot.com/2009/11/mediawiki-book-designer.html">pushed my work to Github</a>, where it sat without much fanfare.<br /><br />Late last week I got a <a href="http://github.com/Whiteknight/mediawiki-bookdesigner/issues/closed#issue/1">message on github</a> from the first confirmed independent user of my extension. Also this week begins the spring semester and the Wittie group have been asking for a few improvements to the extension so they can begin creating new books for the new semester. These things together have spurred me on to begin a new round of hacking. Specifically I'm working on UI improvements, decreasing memory consumption, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I18n">i18n compliance</a>, and a series of other small fixes and feature additions.<br /><br />I've also been spurred on to setup a proper testing environment on my personal laptop. Luckily this is quite easy in Ubuntu: install the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MediaWiki">mediawiki package</a>, enable mediawiki in the Apache config file and restart Apache, setup the wiki, checkout the BookDesigner gadget into the extensions folder, and add a single require_once() directive in the wiki PHP code. Probably took me less than 5 minutes total.<br /><br />It's too bad I'm not an active Wikibookian anymore, this tool would really be making my work there much easier. When it gets a little bit more mature I think it will be a real boon for wiki-based book writers. Still plenty of work to do before we reach that point, however.
