title: It's damn cold
---

The title to this post says it all: It's damn cold outside. I don't know the exact number, I don't need to. It's freezing-freaking cold.<br /><br />Our apartment has a lousy heating system. We've got baseboards along one wall of the apartment broken into three zones with independent thermostats. The problem is that it doesn't work. At least, it doesn't work well. The system has a behavior where it appears to give up if the task is more then it can handle. For instance if we turn the thermostat up to 70, it will be colder then if we have it at 62. When the system tries to work too hard, it stops working at all.<br /><br />Well, today is one of the coldest days of the winter, and the increased temperature differential is more then the little thermostat that could can handle. In short, it's freezing-freaking cold.<br /><br />Dana says it should be warmed up on Monday, although I don't watch the news so I wouldn't know. I hope it's true though, I'm tired of being bundled up in my own damn apartment like a sick Inuit.
