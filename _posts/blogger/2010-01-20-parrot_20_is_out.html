Behold! <a href="http://www.parrot.org/news/2010/Parrot-2.0.0">Parrot 2.0 has been released by chromatic</a>. 2.0 is going to be a supported release that most other projects and end users should be able to target confidently for the next several months.<br /><br />Keep in mind that Parrot uses time-based and not feature-based releases. So 2.0 doesn't strictly satisfy any pre-set group of specifications. It does represent a stable and well-tested version of the software however. The number of feature addititions or performance enhancements from 1.9.0 is actually relatively small, but we have a lot of confidence in this release because of all the testing that has been done to it.<br /><br />I'll have plenty more things to say about 2.0 in the coming days.
