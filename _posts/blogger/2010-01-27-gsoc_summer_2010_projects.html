I saw an <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-discuss/browse_thread/thread/d839c0b02ac15b3f?pli=1">email today from Leslie Hawthorn</a>, the program director for Google's GSoC program. I have not heard official confirmation from anybody, but I can't imagine that Parrot won't apply to be a mentoring organization this year. We've had such good success in the past with it, and so many of the students (including myself!) have stayed on to become long-term productive community members.<br /><br />Mentoring organizations need to apply by the beginning of the March. Students can begin submitting their applications by the end of March. Before that, assuming Parrot gets accepted as a mentoring organization, I think we should have a few ideas for projects prepared. Of course a student is free to come up with any proposal they want, but I think it's good to have some ideas floating around to inspire people beforehand. Parrot has a <a href="http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/BigProjectIdeas">wiki page devoted to project ideas</a> like this, though that page is a little threadbare right now. Any ideas I get will be cross-post to that page as well.<br /><br />I'm going to try to post some good GSoC project ideas on this blog in the coming weeks. If you have a good idea for a project, let me know and I'll write about it. If you're a student and want more information about a particular idea, get in touch and I will do the best I can to steer you in the right direction. Let's hope that this summer turns out as good as previous ones have!
