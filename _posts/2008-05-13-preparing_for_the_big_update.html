title: Preparing for the big update
---

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I've made up my mind today, finally, about what to do to my computer. I had been planning to make the switch to Linux for some time now, but I've decided to move those plans ahead as quickly as possible. So, I plan to spend most of my day tomorrow doing the work on it.<br/><br/>Why so early? Well, there have been a lot of issues that I've run into recently, especially while working on Parrot. Today I got an error (one that i've been getting on occasion for a few days now) that several programs "Cannot load dynamic library MSVCR90.dll". This file, as most programmers should know is version 9.0 of Microsoft's Visual C Runtime. Basically, this is the DLL that implements all of LIBC on windows. Not being able to load this is a big problem for applications that are trying to use standard library functions. <br/><br/>I managed to locate this DLL, burried away in a subfolder of Microsoft Visual C Express Edition, the free version of Microsoft's compiler suite. I moved the DLL to the windows/system32 directory where I knew it would be seen by the system. I have to account for the possibility that i've ruined my PATH variable somewhere along the way. This "worked" in that the error I was previously getting disappeared and a longer, more angry, error was thrown in it's place: "R6034 An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly. Please contact the application's support team for more information". I want to point out that half the programs that throw this error message still execute perfectly. <br/><br/>I don't rule out that this could be some kind of a virus or something, which is all the more reason to switch to a platform that is, at the very least, targeted for viruses less frequently. "Why don;t you switch to Mac?" I can already hear some people asking. The reaason is simple: I don't like vendor lock-in under microsoft, I am certainly not upgrading that to the Orwellian version of the same practiced by Apple. <br/><br/>Tomorrow, then, is the big day. I've got the ISO image for the latest stable Ubuntu downloaded already, and am going to burn it to a disk tonight. I need to backup a lot of data on here too, because I want to avoid the hassle of supporting an NTFS partition on my drive. I have a few requirements of software that I need, but I suspect Ubuntu either has them all included already or has provided an easy way to have them downloaded. <br/><br/></div>
