I spent some time today working on my wikibot program. I got a lot of problems fixed, a lot of details ironed out, and a lot of new features added. I'm probably getting close to the next release, and when that happens I'll probably upgrade the project from alpha to beta.<br /><br />I used the bot yesterday and the day before to help with some edits to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] book on Wikibooks.  That book has over 780 pages, and the bot worked without any kind of problem or complication. My algorithms ended up missing some important corner cases which I needed to go back and fix later, but the bot worked 100% like it was supposed to.<br /><br />As I get the basic functionality written and stabilized, I find myself looking forward to what kinds of cool features or additions I would like to add to it. I've begun writing up a "to do" list for features that I want to add. I am trying to keep the program--overall--relatively quick and light weight, so some of these features might never be implemented, however.<br /><br />There are a couple more things I want to do before I move the project into beta. I definitely want to create an installer for it, and I want to improve a lot of the documentation too. A lot of this is administrative, like creating manifests, readmes, makefiles. I need to be more diligent about including the text of the GPL in my distribution too.
