---

Just a few moments ago Daniel Arbelo (darbelo) released <a href="http://www.parrot.org/news/2010/Parrot-2.1.0">Parrot 2.1.0 "As Scheduled"</a>. It's always nice to see a software project released on time and under budget!<br /><br />Parrot 2.2.0 is scheduled for 16 March, and will be released by Christoph Otto (cotto).
