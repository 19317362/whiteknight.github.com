title: Parroting And Blogs

I spent a good amount of time this morning doing some Parrot work, and even managed to get a few patches submitted and applied. These are all small things, I mostly focus my effort on tracking down and fixing compile-time warnings. Most such warnings are as easy to fix as adding a single type cast, so I don't want to claim that I'm some kind of Parrot super-hacker (which I'm clearly not).<br /><br />I've also been doing a lot of reading lately, blog posts and tutorials and all. I'm sort of prepping myself because I want to enter the GSOC and actually get paid to work on Parrot this summer. I've also been seriously contemplating a switch of my major from EE to CompSci, and this kind of stuff is really going to get me into the mode for that.<br /><br />I've been reading a few blog posts and other pages here and there, and I want to save some links here, mostly for my own convenience.<br /><br />First, <a href="http://use.perl.org/%7Echromatic/journal/35804?from=rss">this post by Chromatic</a> actually made me laugh out loud. I mean, I laughed so hard I startled the dog. I doubt most people will find it as funny as I did.<br /><br />Next, there's a great set of PCT tutorials out there on ParrotBlog. For convenience, I'm going to post links to all of them:<br /><ul><li> <a href="http://www.parrotblog.org/2008/03/episode-7-operators-and-precedence.html">Episode 7:Operators and Precedence</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.parrotblog.org/2008/03/episode-6-scope-and-subroutines.html"> Episode 6: Scope and Subroutines </a> </li><li> <a href="http://www.parrotblog.org/2008/03/episode-5-variable-declaration-and.html"> Episode 5: Variable declaration and Scope </a> </li><li> <a href="http://www.parrotblog.org/2008/03/episode-4-past-nodes-and-more.html"> Episode 4: PAST Nodes and More Statements </a> </li><li> <a href="http://www.parrotblog.org/2008/03/episode-3-squaak-details-and-first.html"> Episode 3: Squaak Details and First Steps </a> </li><li> <a href="http://www.parrotblog.org/2008/03/episode-2-poking-in-compiler-guts.html"> Episode 2: Poking in Compiler Guts</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.parrotblog.org/2008/03/targeting-parrot-vm.html">Episode 1: Introduction</a></li></ul>I've been using these tutorials to start setting up the ground work for my Octave port.<br /><ul><br /></ul>
