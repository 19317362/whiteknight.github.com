title: Running out of Free Time
---

I'm slowly running out of free time recently. Ongoing computer problems have diverted an unfortunate amount of my effort recently, and I haven't been able to develop as much as I would like. It's very hard to get into the swing of a hardcore coding session when your <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/486300">computer freezes or spontaneously reboots</a> every 30 minutes on average. I saw "on average" because sometimes it's much more frequent than that. I had to reboot my computer <span style="font-style: italic;">twice</span> while writing this first paragraph. Thank goodness for Blogger autosaving my drafts.<br /><br />On top of that, <a href="http://whitworthpa.blogspot.com/">we're having a kid</a>. An entire new kid. The due date was on Friday, so now we're officially in over-time and very much looking forward to having an "outside" baby to play with. We both fully expect to be spending some serious time in the hospital this weekend or next week, with sooner being better than later. I've never had any of my own children before, so I'm not entirely certain how it's going to change things. But I am certain that they <span style="font-style: italic;">will change</span>, and probably not in a way that gives me more time to hack on Parrot.<br /><br />Despite my lack of time, this morning I started work on a brand new secret project. I'm not going to give any details about it quite yet (I want to get some more aspects of the design worked out before I go showing off my work), but suffice it to say that if things work out the way I hope they will this project could provide a significant benefit to Parrot and its ecosystem. I'm intending this project to be a Christmas present to the Parrot project, so I hope I can get it done by then. More details to come.<br /><br />I'm also trying to do some work to get :call_sig working properly. Matrixy is definitely going to need improvements there, and I'm sure other projects will want it too. If I can keep the changes small I will just commit it directly. If it starts getting too large, I'll make a branch instead.<br /><br />Matrixy and Parrot-Linear-Algebra are going to take a back seat for now while I focus on other issues and my new secret project. I've got a few cleanups I want to make and some tests to add of course, but no huge development for a little while.
