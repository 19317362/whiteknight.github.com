I wanted a fast bird, and naturally I thought of using "Peregrine Falcon" first. However, considering chromatic's awesome work in plugging memory leaks, I thought it would be more fitting to pick a bird that was both fast <i>and</i> small. We can reserve "peregrine falcon" for a future optimized Parrot <i>par excellence</i>. Maybe that will be the one where we introduce the <a href="/2009/06/11/l1_the_language_of_parrot_internals.html.html">super-fast L1 operations</a>, or a <a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/GCTasklist">faster concurrent GC</a>, or something else extraordinary.
