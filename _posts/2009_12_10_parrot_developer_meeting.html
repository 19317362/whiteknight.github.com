title: Parrot Developer Meeting
---

I should have blogged about this on Tuesday when it was decided. On Sunday, 13 December 2009, we are going to have a virtual Parrot design meeting. <br /><br /><center><br /><h2>3:30 EST</h2><br /><h2>13 December 2009</h2><br /><h2>irc://irc.parrot.org/#parrot</h2><br /></center><br /><br />We are going to talk about the long-term development roadmap and hopefully explicitly lay out our priorities for the forseeable future. I personally would like to see us map out from now through 3.0, but I would be happy if we could just map through 2.6.
