I don't normally talk about current events on this blog. Of course, I don't "normally" talk about any one thing here. Not that it matters of course, I don't have a readership that I'm worried about alienating. Let's hit some news things:<br /><br /><ol><li>Michael Phelps smokes pot. So what? Seriously, I'm not surprised, shocked, or disappointed about this in any way. America, here's a news flash: People under 30 who have never ever ever smoked pot are probably in the minority. The problem with pot is that it ruins people's lives, people give up important things in order to pursue pot, and they end up wasting their lives. Michael Phelps has a box full of olympic gold metals, we don't need to worry that he's not going to amount to anything. If he wants to kill a few brain cells at this point we should let him; he's not celebrated for his mind anyway.</li><li>Miracle on the Hudson. It's not really a miracle, it's a combination of the great engineering that went into the plane, and great training and quick thinking of the pilot and crew. Luck had nothing to do with it, these people involved were experts.</li><li>The stimulus is stupid. Want to help people? You can do it by taking these "toxic" debts away from them. If we have children eating bleach tablets, do we give money to the hospitals to treat them, or do we take the damn bleach tablets away from the children? Banks screwed up by giving bad high-interest debt to people who couldn't afford them, and I can guarantee you that giving money to the banks is not going to fix the problem. You want to help the people in trouble? <a href="http://blog.shankbone.org/2009/02/06/trickleup-economics-and-the-bankruptcy-of-republican-economic-policy.aspx">Give them the money</a>. The unending bullshit of "trickle-down" economics, that some how giving money to rich people will inspire them to eventually give money to poor people, is utterly rediculous. If the government gives me a million dollars, I guarantee that I won't hire 5 people with it: Maybe <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/livecoverage/2008/10/after_bailout_aig_executives_h.html">I'll go on vacation</a>, and <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Wall_Street_CEOs_investment_bankers_charged_0206.html">have a little fun</a> instead. Of course, executives of large corporations would never do that, would they?</li></ol>This is why I don't watch the news, because it's all so boring and stupid.
