title: Parrot 4.7.0 "Hispaniolan" Released!
---

On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 4.7.0, also known
as "Hispaniolan".  [Parrot](http://parrot.org/) is a virtual machine aimed
at running all dynamic languages.

Parrot 4.7.0 is available on
[Parrot's FTP site](ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases/devel/4.7.0/),
or by following the download instructions at
[http://parrot.org/download](http://parrot.org/download).  For those who would
like to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself, we recommend using
Git to retrieve the source code to get the latest and best Parrot code.

Parrot 4.7.0 News:

    - Core
        + Added .all_tags() and .all_tagged_pmcs() methods to PackfileView PMC
        + Several build and coding standards fixes


The SHA256 message digests for the downloadable tarballs are:

Many thanks to all our contributors for making this possible, and our sponsors
for supporting this project.  Our next scheduled release is 18 September 2012.

The release is indeed out a day late. It's not that I forgot about it, it's just
that I can't read a calendar and HOLY CRAP, IT'S WEDNESDAY ALREADY? When did
that happen? So, and I can't stress this enough, **Mea Culpa**.
