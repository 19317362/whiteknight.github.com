title: Parrot Virtual Developer Meeting
---

Allison sent a <a href="http://lists.parrot.org/pipermail/parrot-dev/2010-April/004047.html">message to the list today</a> to schedule a virtual developer meeting for all Parrot developers. The meeting will be this Sunday, 11 April, at 7:30 UTC.<br /><br />All Parrot devs should try to attend. All prospective Parrot devs and well-wishers (GSoC students?) should either try to watch or read the logs afterwards. It will definitely be extremely interesting stuff.<br /><br />I hope to see lots of people there, and I hope we get some good planning work accomplished!
