Parrot's smolder server, previously hosted by plusthree.com, has been down for some days. Today, due to some concerted effort by particle, dukeleto, and the friendly folks at OSUOSL got a new instance of smolder set up for use by Parrot.<br /><br />I introduce you to <a href="http://smolder.parrot.org/">http://smolder.parrot.org</a><br /><br />Reports for Parrot proper are already flying in, but what makes this smolder server so special is that we can add support for other projects as well. Half a dozen other projects are also able to tracked on Smolder: <a href="http://smolder.parrot.org/app/projects/smoke_reports/2">PLA</a>, Lua, PLParrot, Partcl, Rakudo, and Plumage. Not all of these projects have the necessary infrastructure to perform the actual uploads yet, but within a few days I'm sure they all will.<br /><br />Tonight I updated the PLA setup program and test harness to support uploads to smolder, and a few minutes ago I posted the first automated report. We posted a few test reports manually before that too. Everything is looking good so far, though I do have a few tweaks to make. Specifically, I want to include more information about the version of BLAS and LAPACK that are used in the report, which should be easy enough.
