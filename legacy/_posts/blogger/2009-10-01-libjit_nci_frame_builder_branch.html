<a href="/2009/09/29/first_project_challenge_reminder.html.html">I alluded to it earlier</a>, but today is the big announcement: Newcomer Peter Lobsinger has developed a patchset to replace Parrot's ad hoc NCI frame builder with a libJIT-based solution instead, and sent it to me as part of <a href="/2009/09/19/jit_first_project_challenge.html.html">my JIT Challenge</a>. Well, today he set up a <a href="http://github.com/plobsing/parrot-libjit">branch of Parrot on github with the patch</a> for public review. I recommend that all Parrot developers check it out to see what kinds of things are possible in a libJIT-integrated Parrot.
