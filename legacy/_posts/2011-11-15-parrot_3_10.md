title: Parrot 3.10.0 Apple Pi Released!
---

On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 3.10.0, also known
as "Apple Pi".  [Parrot](http://parrot.org/) is a virtual machine aimed
at running all dynamic languages.

Parrot 3.10.0 is available on
[Parrot's FTP site](ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases/devel/3.10.0/), or
by following the download instructions at http://parrot.org/download.  For those
who would like to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself, we recommend
using Git to retrieve the source code to get the latest and best Parrot code.

Parrot 3.10.0 News:

    - Core
        + The mark VTABLE was added to the Select PMC
        + The Parrot::Embed Perl 5 module was removed from parrot.git and now lives
            at https://github.com/parrot/parrot-embed
        + A set_random method was added to the Integer PMC, so random numbers can
            be generated without needing to load math dynops
        + A new implementation of green threads was added to Parrot, in preparation
        for a robust hybrid threading system. Green threads are currently
        not available on Windows.
    - Languages
        + Winxed
          - 'multi' modifier improved
          - throw "string" now emits throw instead of die
          - several optimizations in generated code
          - improved some error dianostics
    - Community
    - Documentation

Many thanks to all our contributors for making this possible, and our sponsors
for supporting this project.  Our next scheduled release is 20 December 2011.
