title: Parrot In GSOC 2012
---

I just got the email a few minutes ago: The Parrot Foundation has been accepted
into the Google Summer of Code program for the summer of 2012!

I haven't wanted to write too much about GSOC until I knew we were accepted. I
thought (hoped) that our application and track record were strong, but I don't
like to take anything for granted. But, now that we are accepted I can (and
will) write as much about it as I want. Unfortuanately I don't have time to
write much today, so here are some links that prospective students should read
over until I have the time to spend in front of my keyboard:

* [List of possible project ideas](https://github.com/parrot/parrot/wiki/Summer-of-Code-Task-Ideas)
* [My guidelines for proposals](http://whiteknight.github.com/2011/04/11/gsoc_proposals.html)
* [Next Steps for prospective students](http://whiteknight.github.com/2011/03/27/gsoc_students_next_steps.html)
* [GSOC Proposal Template](https://github.com/parrot/parrot/wiki/Summer-of-Code-Proposal-Template)

In the coming days I'll be writing about more project ideas.
