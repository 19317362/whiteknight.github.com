Rakudo hacker **moritz** is auditioning for the role of the Good Idea Fairy,
which I personally think he's a shoe-in for. A few days ago in the IRC chatroom
he had this gem:

    moritz>      hey, have you ever thought of starting a parrot advent calendar?
    whiteknight> moritz: sort of, but I wouldn't want to steal your thunder
    moritz>      whiteknight: I wouldn't worry about that. There's usually half a
                 dozen advent calendars in the Perl community, and we don't seem
                 to suffer from that
    ...
    moritz>      whiteknight: don't feel obliged, 'twas just a quick idea. Maybe
                 next year if it's too much work this year
    whiteknight> moritz: If there is one thing I like doing, it's stealing good
                 ideas from the Rakudo folks

So that's what I'm going to try to do: Do a daily advent-ish sort of calendar
for Parrot as similar to the one that [moritz does himself][moritz_advent] as I
can manage. Instead of a normal advent calendar which would be the first 25
days of December, I'm going to do the remaining days leading up to New Years.
Since I'm already running irrepairably late, I won't be able to do 25 daily
posts between now and then. All the better, really, since I am having trouble
coming up with that many ideas! Give me a break, I'm new to this whole advent
thing.

What I say I would like to do, and what I am actually able to get done in the
coming days are two entirely different things. Add the usual holiday stressors
and time-sinks with the cleanups and organizational hassles of moving to a new
house (That's right, we [got the house][new_house]!) and suddenly doing a blog
post every day seems like a pretty daunting order. Again, I will do my best

Every day from now till the end of the year, starting tomorrow, I'm going to try
to post at least a short blurb about something cool in the world of Parrot. I'll
try to focus on things that we've done cool in 2011 or are planning to do come
2012, but if I can find some things worth writing about that are older and are
standing the test of time particularly well, I'll write about that too.

If this goes well and I don't get all lazy and skip too many days, maybe we
can turn this into some sort of regular tradition. If other Parrot hackers want
to jump in and write a short guest post here on this blog, or write their own
posts elsewhere, let me know. More help is more awesome!

Obviously I'm going to mention some of the projects I've been working on
because those are the things I know the most about. I'll try to include a
bunch of cool projects from other people too. Please send me ideas if there
is something **you** want to read about in the coming month.

Tomorrow the advent calendar officially starts. I'm going to begin by talking
about the main course: the bird.
