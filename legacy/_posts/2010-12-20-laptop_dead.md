title: Laptop Dead, Again
---

My personal laptop died last night. Actually, it's more accurate to say that
the backlights on the LCD died. The laptop still runs and I can see the very
feint images on the screen if I hold it up to the right light source.

Unfortunately, the laptop is essentially unusable for more than a handful
of basic emergency tasks until I get this fixed.

I'll still be able to complete the Parrot release, but any primary development
tasks that I had been working on are on hold until I get this resolved.
